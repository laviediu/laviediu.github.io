"If you think you're not worth it, prove that wrong", is a sentence written on the top corner of my whiteboard. Sometimes, I want to scream out loud in the middle of the day, cry myself out in a crowd, not for attention but to place myself among people during the darkest days. That I'll feel less alone.<br>

IU said, "I don't think there is anything as difficult as poverty". I saw the face of poverty growing up; it is familiar, and it is everywhere. As I grew older, I lived in it. Some people can't risk a single failure, some people can afford to fail a thousand times. Some mistake convenience for luxury, some step on luxury like a floor mat.<br>

I am not poor among my folks, I haven't hit my rock bottom. They keep asking me to fly, but my wings are tied to an anchor. They remind me how lucky I am, but my cards keep getting flopped. Maybe I am the problem, maybe I can't see how bright the light is shone upon me. Either way, I keep slipping, losing, drowning. All alone.
