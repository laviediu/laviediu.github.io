Love poems are over now. <br>
I don’t write them anymore.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of words have floated up, gone like clouds. <br>
I’ve spilled so much ink trying to trace something that no longer belongs to me. <br>
And still, <br>
this ocean of sorrow sits within me, <br>
unruly, unresolved, carried by a soul that’s been tangled in its own knots.<br>
<br>
Love—it's not what I once believed. <br>
It’s not just about the butterflies, <br>
the soft glances, or the playful laughs. <br>
It’s not just shared dreams. <br>
Love can be a choice. <br>
A calm, grounded decision. <br>
It can come from the heart, yes—<br>
but also the mind, the spirit, the self.<br>
<br>
I still remember;<br>
Your Batik shirts, your colorful coats, your headsets,<br> 
Your dimpled smile, your waving hand,<br>
Your name showing up in my inbox,<br>
Your grammarly laughed texts,<br>
Your birthday wishes, your I-have-good-news,<br>
My I-have-great-news,<br>
My short mail.<br>
And, of course, my do-not-reply mail, the goodbye.<br>
<br>
I remember the distances too. <br>
One meter. One kilometer. Then six thousand. Then eight. Then ten thousand five hundred. <br>
Love became a measurement of silence and space.<br>
<br>
Your name now stings.<br>
The institution we dreamed of? Just a story now.<br>
The future we imagined? Gone. <br>
Collapsed into a black hole I don’t even try to escape anymore.<br>
<br>
But I can’t hate you. I really can’t.<br>
We smiled, didn’t we? <br>
Even if my tears still come uninvited.<br>
<br>
Love—it was shallow, maybe.<br>
But even in its absence, I still feel its weight.<br>
<br>
We live in different worlds now.<br>
Things have changed—brown sugar has become white.<br>
Rice has turned to porridge. What’s done can’t be undone.<br>
<br>
So this is what I offer you; not a poem, not a love letter. <br>
Just one word.<br>
Happiness.<br>
May you live in it.<br>
Even if I’m not part of it.
