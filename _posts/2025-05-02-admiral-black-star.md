Sunny was my perfect place.<br>
Now the gray sky, <br>
rainy night, <br>
thunderstorm sound, <br>
flashy lightning strike <br>
are utmost comfort.<br>
<br>
It is the familiar, <br>
peaceful, <br>
beautifully cold wind <br>
that hug my whole body.<br>
<br>
It is the ocean <br>
that spreads from east to west, <br>
with eerie waves at night embracing the beach.<br>
<br>
I wonder, is the admiral mesmerized too?<br>
I wonder, within the black placenta of universe, <br>
does the admiral finally touch upon the end of horizon?<br>
<br>
Pondering the edge of raindrops splattering on my backyard, <br>
I sit listening to the melody of calamity.<br>
Calamity that <br>
drowns fear, <br>
imposes courage, <br>
pours warmth.<br>
<br>
I bathe in the snow of black star crystals, <br>
the remnant of apocalypse.<br>
Quirky, <br>
magical, <br>
weird, <br>
free <br>
like showering magnolia petals on a windy instance.<br>
<br>
Is this <br>
what part of Earth civilians are absorbing <br>
under four season spell?<br>
<br>
Admiral, answer me, do you feel the kind my soul do?<br>
