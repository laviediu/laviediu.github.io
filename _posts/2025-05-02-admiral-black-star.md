Sunny was my perfect place.<br>
<br>
Now the gray sky, rainy night, thunderstorm sound, flashy lightning strike are utmost comfort.<br>
<br>
It is the familiar, peaceful, beautifully cold wind that hug my whole body.<br>
<br>
It is the ocean that spreads from east to west, with eerie waves at night embracing the beach.<br>
<br>
I wonder, is the admiral mesmerized too?<br>
<br>
I wonder, within the black placenta of universe, does the admiral finally touch upon the end of horizon?<br>
<br>
Pondering the edge of raindrops splattering on my backyard, I sit listening to the melody of calamity.<br>
<br>
Calamity that drowns fear, impose courage, pour warmth.<br>
<br>
I bathe in the snow of black star crystals, the remnant of apocalypse.<br>
<br>
Quirky, magical, weird, free like showering magnolia petals on a windy instance.<br>
<br>
Is this what part of Earth civilians are absorbing under four season spell?<br>
<br>
Admiral, answer me, do you feel the kind my soul do?<br>
