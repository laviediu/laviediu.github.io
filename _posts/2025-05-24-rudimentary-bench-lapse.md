I was sitting on a bench, sorrounded by huge trees. I was reading a non-fiction collection from my shelf, the one with short biographies of nasty females. Some people walked past me, someone stopped and asked where I come from. With a rock bottom Japanese fluency, I told him my nationality. I casually shared warm greetings whenever I meet Yoshida-san, a sanitary worker in my building, and learned the other day that my major translates to butsuri in Japanese. I continued my business, this time I took out a small note that was given during a conference I attended a few months ago in Miyazaki. I was reminded of that time when a friend had a dinner with me over a Nepalese menu, we discussed the concept of independencen. In the day before my solo-picnic, I was in line for a special vaccination as offered freely by the Japanese government. I had the time to read several abstracts in the hyper-independence studies. I didn't check their impact factor as it would be irrelevant for my curiosity. I positively think that the researchers, with their best ability, conduct the study in fair manners. <br>
<br>
For women, independence is seen as a trauma response. Meanwhile, this critical life skill is not seen as such in men. When, in fact, *hyper*-independence in both genders is due to trauma response. I read the abstracts, thus I am capable to said so, though I don't finish the entire reading. That friend of mine argued that independence, not even hyper-independence, is actually of a trauma response. I am grateful that my mind questioned the very argument. If I was ignorant enough, this would have become a generational trauma. Another type of trauma which is often talked in the social media. Ah, social media, I, too, relentlessly unfiltered any type of contents, as if all of them are factual enough to be taken seriously. Yes, darling, you need to think what type of *ism* that you want to feed your brain with. <br>
<br>
I have no interest in taking this any longer as my sleep time will be compromised and my paper is due, by a self-imposed deadline, at the end of this week. My experiments also required more than six hours of standing, I suffered cramps last week because one should exercise so much they could stand for ten hours a day. Anyway, I should proceed to my rants. Remember? The one that I wrote on my small note from the conference during my momentary rest on a bench.<br>

I sincerely think Thoreau is helping me with mindset shifting, though I still loudly laugh every time he hits too close to society's failure. Attaboy. I am taking myself home to a bed where I am looking forward to some weird dreams I have about old acquaintances or strangers I won't remember.
