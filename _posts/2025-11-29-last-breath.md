The world is upset, it is me, I am,<br>
who believed the good in humans, who put faith in humanity.<br>
It is lost.<br>
<br>
I wander through deserts, across oceans, over mountains,<br>
but there is no place for me to stay.<br>
<br>
The little light that brings my heart on fire,<br>
warm and fuzzy,<br>
it is gone.<br>
<br>
My tears run a river but my heart is hollow.<br>
It does not shout, talk, nor whisper.<br>
<br>
I run, my bare feet are bleeding.<br>
The road is red, yet I keep my steps.<br>
Flood of tears washes the red road, dragging my body to shore.<br>
I am drown, the wave takes my soul to the burial ground.<br>
Mother Earth hugs my darkened soul, and<br>
God smiles that I am leaving them all behind.
