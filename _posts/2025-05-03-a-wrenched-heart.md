A teen fantasy,<br>
A lousy daydream,<br>
A silly smile, <br>
A full of tears day,<br>
I read upon your impossible mind.<br>
<br>
Those nights,<br>
Those long walks,<br>
A heart was wrenched.<br>
<br>
Your sharp words,<br>
Your longing for beauty,<br>
Your complex mentality,<br>
Your mesmerizing eyes,<br>
Your enchanting smile,<br>
Your playful acts,<br>
Your sweet stories,<br>
Your ice cream laughs,<br>
Perfection.<br>
<br>
Our awkward hello,<br>
Our shared piece, Nuvole Bianche,<br>
Our drinks,<br>
Our short ride from the uni,<br>
Our jammed toast,<br>
Our finger dipping in the ocean,<br>
<br>
Here I throw,<br>
Fuck.<br>
<br>
I said goodbye to the teen,<br>
She holds the 18th century sword,<br>
She sang a long eulogy,<br>
for you, my king.<br>
<br>
Shade was choked,<br>
Iron necklace was wrapped on the black hands,<br>
Sword was swung to the black heart,<br>
A shade can't be killed.<br>
<br>
She rises again,<br>
She is not coming back.<br>
