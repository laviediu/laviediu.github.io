I will live when the wind blows through my black scarf. I will live when the sunlight illuminates my green curtain. I will live when the birds chant the morning melody. I will live when the ducks swim on the clear riverbed. I will live when people are sitting next to the pond, fishing all day with unseen smiles on their faces. I will live when the flowers bloom, when rain pours, when leaves turn yellow, when the first snow falls. I will live when my soul leaves its home.
