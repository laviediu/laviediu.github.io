I will live when the wind blows through my black scarf.<br>
<br>
I will live when the sunlight illuminates my green curtain.<br>
<br>
I will live when the birds chant the morning melody.<br>
<br>
I will live when the ducks swim on the clear riverbed.<br>
<br>
I will live when people are sitting next to the pond, fishing all day with unseen smiles on their faces.<br>
<br>
I will live when the flowers bloom, when rain pours, when leaves turn yellow, when the first snow falls.<br>
<br>
I will live when my soul leaves its home.<br>
