*"Sweetheart, who else are you working so hard for?"*, she texted. Tears suddenly coming out of my eyes. Not becuase of what she said, but the way time somehow brought me to the future when Mom is gone, when Dad is not there too, when I am all alone in my bed without a single motivation to wake up. Something I always feel scared of.<br>
<br>
Ever since I was little, I develop this thing to rely on myself, to remember that I will be on my own at the end. When I said that loneliness is familiar, I meant it as a way to survive, by keeping loneliness as my very best friend. If I train myself to feel lonely, I would just feel the same when the real loneliness comes.<br>
<br>
Her words mark my time. Every time I look at her, I notice how different she has become. I hate to see the wrinkles when she smiles. I hate to see how hard she is working without proper rest. I hate how distance keeps us apart, and yet when we are together for too long we would start bickering every day.<br>
<br>
She had me when she was twenty years old. I always hated it when people said that we look like sisters, but now I feel beyond grateful whenever people say that.<br>
<br>
So, Mom, I am begging you, please don't get sick. Please live longer than me. Ah, I am ruining my skin-cared face. I am not crying, you are.
