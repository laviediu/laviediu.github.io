Oh here I go again. Everyone must remember that moment, what they did when it happened. For me, it was a morning. I woke up bamboozled by a weird dream. This is why a morning routine with prayer is good. I had my period, it was already 8 AM. The air is darn cold, and my bed is too warm.<br>
<br>
As usual, I begin the morning turning off alarm threads which ring every 10 minutes. There were email notifications. My supervisor exchanged an email at 1.32 AM with our English collaborator. And I was convinced that he is a vampire, "does he not sleep?". I didn't read the full conversation, instead, I swiped left and right. Right; I have a Duolingo streak to do, what a demanding bird?! Left; Japanese politics, new tech on the block, the US blabbers, AI and stuff, all the things I don't need to read in the morning. Yet, I still can't take my mind off of this uninvited person in the weird dream. I googled his name. Oh how I wish I live in the 80s, I would've felt enough knowing we don't reside in the same island.<br>
<br>
Now, before the judgements are thrown. This person inspired me to write the *"le coup de foudre"* piece. It is the kind of love I would keep out of innocence. If someone had filmed me when I was 19, running through the university hallway and telling my girlfriends giggly, "he waved at me! he talked to me!", I would want to watch it over and over. Because it's beautiful, and I didn't ask for more.<br>
<br>
And there it was, a wedding announcement. "I knew it. Of course it is! Unbelievable", was my immediate reaction. How else my 6th sense is going to tell me, of course it's through a dream. The wedding was a month ago, "ah, that's why he's been invading my dreamscape". I was both speechless and happy for him. Happy is an overstatement, I was quite sad, but not sad it-broke-me sad, sad i-wish-i-will-meet-someone-too sad. This kind of experience could be horrifying for some people, especially the ones involving first love.<br>
<br>
I texted my mom, "Do you remember that one time I cried in the kitchen because I told someone I liked him? He is already married. I'm sad, but I don't cry". She replied, with emojis (the one with a face full of love and the kissing face) she always use, "That's okay, honey, don't be sad. Believe that Allah prepares the best for you, don't lose your hope".<br>
<br>
Some people are lucky, they marry their first love, just like my parents. I'm not saying that I resent Allah's plan, but to be able to feel it and seal it forever through marriage, that's such a tremendous rizq.<br>
<br>
And hey, even if you are my first love, I want to say that I'm genuinely happy for you, though I still hope you'll have Indonesian dads belly VERY SOON. Forgive me, yaa Rabb, I need the win. I know that someone is also waiting for me in the other end, and I'm not going to lose this hope just because you get to the start line first.<br>
<br>
Goodbye, oh *le coup de foudre*, don't you ever visit me in the dream again, it's a reserved place for my last love! Even better, I *really really really* want to love Rasulullah, and I hope someday he will visit my dreamscape :)
