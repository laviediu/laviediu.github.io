Suddenly it's Friday again! I am recently obsessed with home shopping. Perhaps it comes with age. Hey, I'm in my delicate era :). I was never the type of woman who cared much about home decor; I liked it minimal, in whatever default color came with the rented room.<br>
<br>
However, everything changed after my duvet cover went from brown to light green (matching my curtains). I am *a d d i c t e d*. And it only got worse after my green checkered rug arrived. Good God, my room is pretty! I even ordered another rug for the kitchen floor, a pink Persian-style beauty. It is so cute I could die. Imagine a bedroom with a soft green-and-pink theme!<br>
<br>
Honestly, after three winters without warm floors, I think this is a good investment. And because I’ve been spending long work hours with no real chance to go anywhere on weekends (why be among crowds when I can read or watch shows in my pretty room alone?!), the timing feels right. Hehe.<br>
<br>
My paper is still in the air, unlike love, which is certainly in the deep dark ocean. I keep wondering if my two-year efforts are meaningless. And since the equipment I’m supposed to use frequently, *four days a week frequently*, is malfunctioning, I have to switch to simulation work. It’s quite a task to gather a brilliant idea with little knowledge. Guess it’s a weekend project now.<br>
<br>
In contrast, my internship research is going pretty well. My manager offered a raise. Of course, I’m not naive anymore, haha. I worked about 12 hours yesterday because I didn’t make enough time earlier this week. Honestly, it was a good alternative, since commuting takes two hours. I could feel my bones being tired, but in a good way.<br>
<br>
This Wednesday I was stuck in my room, partly because my supervisor was working remotely, so I decided to work from home. My 90 × 180 cm whiteboard is already full of blabbers. Yet I still have very little idea of what is happening with my samples. I need to learn more indeed! Ah, do I even deserve a PhD?!?!?!?!?! My advice to anyone considering one: DON’T! This gets depressing.<br>
<br>
Interesting fact: I brought cheap tea from Indonesia, the kind sold in bulk wrapped in paper. You get big leaf pieces instead of powdery teabags. It’s not as bothersome as you might think if you just let it sit for a minute. The taste? Honestly as good as Ahmad Tea from London, haha. I like the smell of Ahmad Tea, especially their sweet tea collections. It’s decaffeinated too. The only downside? Not as friendly on the pocket :)<br>
<br>
In summary, I am addicted to tea and home improvement projects. Hopefully the latter won’t last. Ah, another uneventful week, which is actually good. What, midnight already? Time for a shower and bed. Bye!
