I just turned 26. It doesn't feel different haha. It did feel a bit heavy last year though, turning a quarter of a decade.<br>
<br>
My life felt like in a reset mode last weekend. I hiked, for only 2 hours, in Nagano area. The scenery was magically breathtaking. We were in a group of 10 people, but I was alone mid-hike. I couldn't catch my breath and my head felt very dizzy. "Your eyes look super weird", she said. I stopped midway and let my friends leave me behind. I was taking one step at a time in the steep course. I was hiking behind a group of foreign tourists, possibly in their thirties. After letting my heart to beat a little slower, yes it was racing, I went after my friends. My energy was refueled and I hiked faster to the top, leaving them behind. On the way up, I reminded myself, "a little bit more, you can endure it" while uttering some dhikr repeatedly. The hike reconnected my soul to where it belongs, I felt closer to God. It was the best feeling I have had in a while, a peace I was looking for the whole time. It could even be the highlight of 2025.<br>
<br>
As I went down, I had deep conversations with my best friend, the one that I categorize as one of *my people*. I said all the things I couldn't say to anyone, and she did the same. We haven't met in years and we finally reconnected again. The difficult track became very manageable and felt shorter with one of my best friends next to me. We spent the night in a beautiful lodge. I learned a lot from her, and I saw how beautiful she has grown as a person. The way she spent her days, it motivated me to do more. We spent most of the time talking about silly things. Perhaps it is the way our jokes match, unapologetically corny. My birthday felt like the best birthday I have had in a while, the second after the one where Mom and Dad bought me a chocolate cake with cherries on top. The one when I understand how it felt like to truly love someone, and to ache deeply for letting a good friend slipped away.<br>
<br>
"I want to go back again next year", I told her. "Or maybe somewhere else", she added. I still don't understand whether it was because of her presence, or the scenery, or the hike, or the quiet village, or the journey itself, that makes me feel whole, but I know very well that I wouldn't feel those feelings without her being there. I missed the moment to write it, but the journey I had in Jakarta with my other best friends gave similar feelings. So, here's to them, *my people*.<br>
