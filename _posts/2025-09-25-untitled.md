i have this day, sometimes<br>
a day of blank<br>
space,<br>
mind,<br>
heart<br>
<br>
i let<br>
my body behind the yellow line,<br>
my shade crushed by the express train<br>
<br>
the wind<br>
blew my skirt<br>
embraced my blank face<br>
<br>
a day like this happens, sometimes<br>
*this day shall pass like any day*<br>
<br>
tomorrow,<br>
a blank day<br> 
or a different day<br>
must emerge
