I don't want to keep living because dying is sinful. "What do you want to do in your life?" My head keeps reassuring my decisions, but my heart keeps aching. It feels as if someone is shooting bullets while tearing my skins. I don't want to write only when I am falling, but my pens come when life asks how I am doing. I am screaming in front of the crowds, and everyone is screaming on their own. My room is dark, but where I am now is darker than Earth without moon. God, may I go to the heaven and leave this all behind? I am only passing time, and the shade of rainbow crossing beautiful waterfall keeps calling me in the dream. I am not your best servant, but give me a reason to live other than for two beautiful people who brought me into this world.
