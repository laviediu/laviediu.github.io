It was such a ride, this week. I have never used my brain so much, at this capacity, that I realized I should do this more. It has been a very long time since I dedicate almost half of my Saturday to sleep. Also, to put aside getting proper meals for lunch without breakfast. No, it is not the life that I want, but I guess at some point in life, it is what it is.<br>
<br>
In my long nap this afternoon, suddenly, a person I know from the past appeared in my dream, he passed away several years ago and he lived just in front of my house. I woke up crying. In the dream, he was in a car on the way to hospital. I stayed in my hometown for more than 18 years, the neighbors become my distant family, particularly the senior residents. They are the ones I grew up with, the ones I visited every Eid celebration. When I returned last year, most of them already passed. They are gone, just like that. I haven't been home for two years. My warm neighborhood felt a bit colder, though there are many new residents. I didn't feel anything when I heard the news of their death. The feelings are now flooding, my time to grief.<br>
<br>
And the faces of people around me resurface. Someday, I will be alone. Human evolution, Hawa was not supposed to be alone, nor Adam. Yet, is it correct to let connections flourish out of loneliness? Maybe, if I live in a foreign island with only two inhabitants. It is justified and highly required for survival. We would look after each other, sleeping at different times because there could be lions or tigers hunting for human flesh.<br>
<br>
I affirmed myself, "Perhaps, twenties are supposed to be like this. However, you are allowed to take a rest too. You can take the heavy weight off your shoulders. And thank you for choosing to wake up every day".
