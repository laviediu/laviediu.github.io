When I love, I want to love with my whole being—<br>
from the tip of my hair to the soles of my feet.<br>
<br>
I want to read love poems aloud<br>
in front of your blushing cheeks.<br>
<br>
I want to dance in a white dress with floral patterns,<br>
the one I’ve long wanted to buy and show off.<br>
<br>
I want to cook a variety of dishes and fill the dining table,<br>
then leave a pile of dirty plates for you to wash.<br>
<br>
I want to tug on your strong hand<br>
and whine until you agree to go on morning walks with me.<br>
<br>
I want to press my forehead toward you<br>
for a kiss every night.<br>
<br>
I want to buy all kinds of flower and vegetable seeds<br>
to build a little garden—<br>
and I will wait to see what you’ll do<br>
when the roses bloom, when the tomatoes and eggplants ripen.<br>
<br>
I want to sit on the sofa, read a book,<br>
and ask you to nap on my lap.<br>
<br>
I want to call my mother and father,<br>
hand you the phone,<br>
then listen to your sweet laughter<br>
as you tell them all the silly things I did that day.<br>
<br>
I want to rewatch all my favorite dramas<br>
and cry or fall asleep on your shoulder.<br>
<br>
I want to order too much food at a restaurant<br>
and ask you to finish two-thirds of every dish.<br>
<br>
I want to be a princess every month when that time comes,<br>
making you fetch things for me and stroke the top of my head.<br>
<br>
I want to dry your hair after a shower,<br>
then kiss your cheek.<br>
<br>
I want to go to the beach, bring camping gear,<br>
and enjoy a starry night with you.<br>
<br>
I want to explore many islands in Indonesia<br>
and the beautiful countries of Central Asia—<br>
laughing freely,<br>
being amazed again and again with you.<br>
<br>
I want to gaze into your eyes before falling asleep,<br>
then ask, “How was your day?”<br>
<br>
I want to run, drop my heavy bag,<br>
and hug you tightly after a long solo trip.<br>
<br>
I want to slip my hand into the pocket of your big jacket.<br>
<br>
I want to wear your shirt, let my hair down,<br>
and ask, “Don’t I look sexy?”<br>
<br>
I want to watch that serious face of yours as you work,<br>
and capture it with my old, scrappy camera.<br>
<br>
I want to wake up early,<br>
get you a glass of warm water,<br>
crawl back into bed and play with your hair until you wake,<br>
then smile wide and say, “Good morning, my love.”<br>
<br>
I want to sing karaoke<br>
and dedicate dozens of love songs to you.<br>
<br>
Oh, when I love,<br>
I love fully—<br>
I love without limits.
