It is a memento after a long day at work and my head is recovering from migraine due to, supposedly, iron deficiency. It took me almost 30 minutes to find a restaurant inside Tokyo station because certainly I am not built for a bagel-for-lunch kind of lady. My mom would say, it's not considered as meals if you don't eat rice. Very well, mother.<br>
I want to scream the title at its peak!!! Lately I am hyped up by an idea of kinetic inductance detectors and I'm thinking of implementing the project for my next PhD research. I DON'T KNOW IT IS SUPER AWESOME! I am also super hyped because another woman joined the department I'm currently working at! You certainly don't know how it feels like to be the only woman in a team. I was when I entered my lab at grad school, at that time there was one female student who graduated a semester later. ALL I KNOW IS THAT IT IS GOOD TO HAVE FEMALE FRIENDS IN THE WORKPLACE! I was just looking at some acknowledgements from theses online, I don't know those people, but I stumbled across a very beautiful one where it said,<br>
<br>
*"To all women before me who have sacrificed everything to live a decent life"*<br>
<br>
Damn.<br>
Thank you to all women scientists and engineers who are and are not written in history books!<br>
