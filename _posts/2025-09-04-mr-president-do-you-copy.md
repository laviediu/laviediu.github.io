Mr. President, I giggled when I saw a middle-class friend telling everybody that he is *giving back* by showing the success methods he had as a middle-class born. Well, he *tried*, better than myself who wrote unsent letters to you. I bet he has no idea how it feels to be a low-income family, not that he needs to. However, if, *if* the people representing citizens, *all* of them including high-middle-low-whatever-you-name-it, does *not* know how to emphatize with how they feel, and of course a feeling of riding a BMW is incomparable to spending hours of commute from a small village to the big city, then the institution itself can *not* be called a house of representative.<br>
<br>
Mr. President, my friends are insurmountably loud, that I stop using social media altogether. And they should do that, rather than writing a letter without address. Yet, all I hear from those who are not my friends is quietness, apologies, excuses, some even flew from the scene, unbelievable. I reckon the sweet mouth my not-friends once had, when they roared through the streets and shaked hands with the low-whatever-you-name-it. I wish I grabbed their hands, hard, but I have never been on the streets. Should my not-friends be given a ferrari for their possibly not-fake smiles and handshakes and time spent riding a BMW?<br>
<br>
Mr. President, I am tired. Partly because I have three jobs, partly because my friends don't even have decent jobs. Because they work tirelessly, and yet more than half of their paychecks go to meals. But Mom said that the students do not like their meals at school, she probably meant that they do not like steamed carrots and eggs. Kids, right? Not all kids love omelet and vegetable soups like me. I have a friend who doesn't eat vegetables, at all. Well, I am no regulation expert, but *uniform* might not work for no military officers. I used to wear black-taped shoes, because it had white lines on the soles. Oh yeah, public schools required all-black shoes, not no-brand black shoes, apparently.<br>
<br>
Mr. President, what have *we* done? what have *the deads* done? I can *not* blame a single person for everything that happens from the Majapahit kingdom or VOC colonialization or capitalism or a dictator or corruptors, can I? I may have a tainted heart, but it is not all-black, like the shoes. I do not blame you. This letter serves as a *kentongan*, the sound I always hear at 12 am when I was home or the one I hear everyday at 5 pm now that I reside in Japan.<br>
<br>
Mr. President, I always switched the channel from terrible news to Spongebob or Chalkzone every morning. Dad wasn't mad though, he laughed with me watching Spongebob Squarepants or Rudy Tabootie. Perhaps, he was tired too. I don't know how he would feel *now*, but if he was tired 20 years ago, he must be *insurmountably* tired now. Just like me, stopping to use social media altogether, switching the channel to private-whatever-letter to you, quietly.<br>
<br>
Mr. President, it is 1.30 in the morning, my eyes is telling me to sleep but my mind can not stop typing. Do you also have nightmares and insomnia, like I do? Or do you sleep peacefully like a kitten? I wouldn't wish the former, but am I *too much* for asking you not to have the latter? But again, you are Mr. President, you need a very good night rest so that you can lead the country without apologizing, *again*, tomorrow.
