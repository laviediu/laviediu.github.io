This house believes that over-productivity is *not* an issue, oppositions are generously welcomed, ballots are distributed.
<br>
I began a new habit formation several weeks ago, in an attempt to solve the guilt-tripping I had over the weekend. Perhaps you can easily guess it. Yes, binge-watching shows! I didn’t know that I somehow manipulate my own self to justify that this behavior is totally normal and acceptable. Apologize for those having different views on this, but, it *certainly* wasn’t healthy, at all, *for me*. Why is that? Because I would feel completely guilty after the activity, rather than feeling satisfied and *healed* which should be the point of relaxation over the weekend. Hence, the key point here is that if you are *not* feeling guilty doing whatever routines you do, you are not on the wrong track. You may have different belief with me, unless probably you are a believer of God or a humanist, but humans are capable of discerning morally good and bad things. Period.

I was at the level of being extremely bored. Think of the moment when you listen to a song so much that it begins to sound bad, like really bad. At this point, all shows seem superficial and have no entertainment factors anymore. I began to look at my book shelf again, reading the books I haven’t finished, or buying new books to read--without feeling guilty. I started to go out, of course after a long weather debate with myself, simply to notice my surroundings and *feel* the nature. And. It. Has. Been. Life. Changing.
<br>
I am a type of person who plans a whole week in advance, most of the time, except during holiday break. Presumably, if the mentioned new habit formation is effective, I would also plan my holiday break. Haha. My typical week usually consists of two to three major activities in a day--mostly my PhD experiments, with "rest" or "hangout with friends" description during the weekend. Lately, I noticed a new dynamics with three to *six* activities daily. What do I feel? Utterly satisfied. I hummed brightly at the end of the day, not that I didn't normally do humming, it feels *extremely* satisfying.
<br>
This should be enough for a statement. Remember, I welcome any oppositions, but please keep it for yourself. 
<br>
Ah also, I did re-design this whole website during my "new habit formation experiments"--writing several poems, some that I am proud of, and some others that don't need any explanations whatsoever. By the way, I also landed a new opportunity, partly thanks to this experiment.

Au revoir!
