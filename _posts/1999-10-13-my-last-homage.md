If love was ever enough,<br>
I would go to you, <br>
slowly, <br>
steadily, <br>
like how the leaves fall in autumn. <br>
<br>
If love was enough, <br>
I would let you to love me<br> 
entirely, <br>
without waiting for years. <br>
<br>
If love was enough, <br>
I would let us <br>
love, <br>
argue, <br>
then reconcile. <br>
<br>
If love was ever enough, <br>
I would write<br>
every single thing <br>
that made me <br>
fall in love with you. <br>
<br>
If love was enough, <br>
I would never ask you <br>
to let me go. <br>
<br>
If love was enough, <br>
I would hold your hand <br>
like there was storm coming to us. <br>
<br>
If love was ever enough, <br>
I would let myself <br>
to express my disappointment <br>
and let you treat me better. <br>
<br>
If love was enough, <br>
I would come to you <br>
whenever life gets too difficult. <br>
<br>
If love was enough, <br>
you would never wonder <br>
whether your feelings are reciprocated. <br>
<br>
If love was ever enough, <br>
if life was ever ideal, <br>
I would let you choose me <br>
for however messy I am. <br>
