I practically had a marathon of *Jurassic Worlds*, three of them at least, this weekend while working on both my poster and oral presentations for the conferences I have this month.<br>
<br>
My supervisor asked my time and *mental*, as he put it, commitment to renew my internship contract. I was so sure that I would end it because I haven't had proper rest this summer. I want to bake and run in the morning again! Yet, as I re-think the decision, I am not feeling satisfied with what I have done so far. Not the kind of satisfaction humans-are-never-satisfied, but the kind of satisfaction where I feel like this-system-could-be-much-better. If I were to end it, I feel like I improved nothing, although my supervisor said that I have given so much insights to the team. I also achieved the internship goal so far, but I haven't been able to use my material science knowledge, the very reason I was hired in the first place. And so, *I renewed the contract*.<br>
<br>
"*Are you happy?*", with a serious face he asked.<br>
<br>
I laughed. What a philosophical question. Suddenly I was reminded by one of my best friend's text, "*happiness is a mood, it is not a destination*".<br>
<br>
"*I know that I won't be happy if I end my internship here, when I finally master the experimental setup*".<br>
<br>
"*Though I could really use a break. I will go to Seoul for a conference this month, I think it would be a good chance to unwind*", I added.<br>
<br>
"*But still, it is a work then*", he replied worriedly.<br>
<br>
I spent two to three days a week for this summer internship, and I committed for two days a week for the upcoming months. I requested to opt out of the unnecessary meetings so that my time is focused solely on experiments and important meetings. Lately, I always come in the afternoon and leave in the late evening, thus I could be at the lab in the morning. I also asked to conduct data analysis at home instead of the office. I brought it all up and he agreed to my requests.<br>
<br>
As I sat on Chuo line's train bench, reading Jacinda Ardern's memoir, I stumbled upon her pregnancy test and a presenter questioning her whether a PM could take a maternity leave. She was working as a PM *and* becoming a new mother. Of course, this is nowhere near as *that*, but I am amazed at myself for trying to push a capacity I didn't know I have, as a woman. This could be a good tryout, I thought. I also started to wonder, "*What would my life look like ~~if~~ when I become a mother someday?*".<br>
<br>
"*You can do it*", Mom reassured my anxiety. I had this discussion during our phone calls several months ago, "*I am not sure if I want to be a mother, if I could be a good mother*".<br>
<br>
It still feels quite unreal that I will soon turn 26 years old. There are a lot of new things I need to think and be responsible of. Beside my once-in-two-months financial planning spreadsheet update, I need to pay resident tax and handle tax-return procedures every year. This was unnecessary with the government scholarship I had for my master's. Now that I have a research fellowship, everything changed, for the better. I wonder how much I should pay next March, when practically I have two jobs; part-time R&D engineer and teacher assistant. It is good that the fellowship allowance should be tax-free though. Alright, it has been too much *tax-talking*. And by the way, I am grateful *and* satisfied with the services of Japanese government, so I am not bitter, haha.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mom, for being very supportive with me living abroad even though I am an only child.<br>
I took all the good things God gave me for granted, really.<br>
I hope I could go home next year for a full month stay :)<br>
And yes, I will always be your little girl.
