It is almost midnight, I just arrived an hour ago. My face is already *skin-cared*, ready for bed. "Should I open it now, or should I wait tomorrow or maybe this weekend or maybe never?". My heart wasn't even beating fast when I clicked the announcement, I don't care anymore. It broke my heart last year, so hard that I didn't even know how to recover from it. I almost never gave anything a second chance. If this wasn't an obligation from my current fellowship, I wouldn't waste my time to write another application, which I know very well will be rejected, not because the content is bad, but because I'm not *qualified* enough, no paper publication nor awards. Fluff. This is getting very bitter and overly dramatic haha.<br>
<br>
My day is good. I went to the university in the morning to do a short experiment. I cooked my lunch, watched *Young Sheldon* and hurt my stomach from laughing, then continued my day to work. I changed my typical train from subway which transits at Tokyo station to the common train. I get to see the boats in Kanda river every afternoon and evening. It somehow reminds me of Derek Shepherd and his thing for ferryboats in Seattle haha. The temperature is not scorching hot anymore. I love being both a part-time worker and a student, I couldn't ask for something better. Also, I almost finish my paper, if my supervisor finally accepts it. It is frustrating how many times it should be revised, ugh, I don't even want to read it anymore.<br>
<br>
This rejection may mean something though. Perhaps, indeed, I shouldn't pursue a career in academia. I feel much much much, three times huh, happier working in a company, somehow, though the work is pretty much the same. Now I am not even sure I want to continue my career to a postdoctoral program. I want to attend more startup events and I do want to work on my ideas, founding a company someday. I am so grateful now that I didn't receive a letter from Oxford, leaving me all bored and ended up looking for an internship.<br>

Anyway, the title is related to the dopamine power that comes from reward prediction error. I enjoyed "*The Molecule of More*", thank you very much. It was very fun to read, easier than reading "*Thinking, Fast and Slow*", haha. From knowing whether I would be a Democrates or Republicans, the book revealed a lot I didn't know about myself. Ah, hormones and neurotransmitters. I need to remind myself more of dopamine's role in every aspect of my life. Whoops, how is the career decision now? To be continued!
