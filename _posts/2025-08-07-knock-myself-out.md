It is an hour before morning prayer. My insomnia has been kicking in, again. There are a lot of words circling in my mind as I put my head on the pillow. Oh God.<br>
<br>
I hate to treat this website as a diary but oh what a girl can't do. It is funny how God tests me with my faith this year.<br>
<br>
First, a person confessed to me of wanting to convert. I took the person to a mosque. I found a good introductory book, memoir of some sort. I also had discussions, though only blabbers came out of my mouth.<br>
<br>
Second, I watched a lot, too much, debates about Islam and atheism on YouTube during ramadhan. What a mess, it was mostly filled with bitterness and how one can win argument better.<br>
<br>
Third, a huge disappointment. As if the sword wasn't deep enough, God showed me that the person I was hoping to share the same values with ended up telling me that we are not, at the very least, having similar principles. I felt betrayed. It was as if witnessing infidelity firsthand. I was speechless at the time. Then, angry and disappointed. My anger is almost gone now, and I wish to no involvement of any meaningful social intercourse with the party. I can't believe I could be *that* disappointed. Perhaps, it was the silence. Perhaps, it was the fact that the other party informed such significant matter as a mere *announcement*. <br>
<br>
Alright, I have knocked myself out.<br>
<br>
Faith is personal for me. It was very personal that I struggled with the idea of me conveying what I believe to other people. Until I understand that it is actually *not* because of the message, but how God puts the *faith* in one's heart. <br>
<br>
There are tons of questions I am still seeking the answers to. I desperately ask God, every now and then, to never take this faith from me. I always know right away when my heart starts to feel empty, my days become unfulfilling, and I am not in my best self. It is honestly the one of many things why I hold on to this faith. The way of life. This faith didn't promise anything to me. I am not obligated to follow anything if I don't want to, I am given rights. There are consequences of course. Yet, the most beautiful thing is that no one, no single creature, knows how you will end up. Only God knows.<br>
<br>
I demanded, "please give me something, anything". And right away when I opened the Holy Book on the last verse that I recited.<br>
<br>
"*Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His signs? Beware, the unjust shall not prosper*".<br>
<br>
Right here, right now, I wish I could understand Arabic so that I *know* what it means. Too bad that even with only 3 languages, my speaking ability in all three of them has recently become a major issue. Oh limitless creature.
