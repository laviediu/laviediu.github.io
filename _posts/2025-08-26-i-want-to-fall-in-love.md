I am waiting for my last sample measurement, with the migraine killing my left head. I forgot my iron supplement. I was home at 1 am last night, almost missing the last train, had the insomnia until 3 am, finally slept after my mind felt better by exhausting it with the meeting report. "*So.. Sally can wait, she knows it's too late*", I know that too!<br>
<br>
I woke up at 6.30, went to the lab for preparing the samples, took a 1.5 hour train, and had the measurement until now; 9 pm. I slept for 30 minutes at the train though and 30 minutes in between the measurement waiting time, probably the best thing I had today, aside from the red bean doughnut from the cafetaria. I will be home probably at almost 11 pm today, and have to wake up at 7.30 tomorrow. God, I miss running at the park and thinking nothing except singing pop songs and casually writing poems after the run. I want to skip this summer madness and wake up in December! Oh boy, this turned to a diary again, whatever, I know my future self would appreciate how hard I work this summer.<br>
<br>
And so, Mom dropped a bomb this weekend. Surprise surprise! Honestly I saw it coming, she was trying to push it in but I knew she would break and tell me right away haha. I don't know Mom, really. Isn't it weird that I feel like I don't need anyone except myself right now, while, having the idea of being with someone is as enticing as it could be. How would I feel to let myself fall in love again? I could get hurt, or I could be much happier, or I could be a totally different person though this one is questionable. My life could get more interesting, or my life could turn upside down, or my life could be more challenging. I don't know. But, Mom, I *do* want to fall in love, again. And if I could, I think it would be worth the risks.<br>
