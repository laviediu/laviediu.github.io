Home looks near
Home feels fine
Home is the way I return
to you

The melody follows my day
May I dream?
The dream I never dare 
to dream

This hand
This untouchable hand
This trembling hand
This anxious hand
is reaching towards 
you

Years passed
Moments lapsed
Will this be fated
or will you take my hand
instead?
