Home looks near<br>
Home feels fine<br>
Home is the way I return<br>
to you<br>
<br>
The melody follows my day<br>
May I dream?<br>
The dream I never dare<br>
to dream<br>
<br>
This hand<br>
This untouchable hand<br>
This trembling hand<br>
This anxious hand<br>
is reaching towards<br>
you<br>
<br>
Years passed<br>
Moments lapsed<br>
Will this be fated<br>
or will you take my hand<br>
instead?<br>
