When I do love, I love entire—<br>
From crown of head to foot’s desire.<br>
No half, no shard, no guarded part,<br>
But all I am, I give my heart.<br>
<br>
I’ll read love’s verses bold and bright<br>
Before your cheeks, flushed pink with light.<br>
<br>
In gowns of white with blossoms spun,<br>
I’ll dance beneath the setting sun.<br>
<br>
I’ll lay a feast with care and grace,<br>
Then leave the plates for you to face.<br>
<br>
With pleading hand and morning plea,<br>
I’ll beg you, love, to walk with me.<br>
<br>
Each night I’ll offer up my brow,<br>
A kiss, your seal, my sacred vow.<br>
<br>
I’ll plant small seeds in earthen bed,<br>
And wait to see your heart’s thread—<br>
When roses bloom and fruits appear,<br>
Will you draw close or disappear?<br>
<br>
Upon the couch, a book in hand,<br>
Your head upon my lap shall land.<br>
<br>
I’ll call my kin, and hand to you<br>
The phone to share what mischiefs grew—<br>
And while you speak and laugh so sweet,<br>
My foolish tales will feel complete.<br>
<br>
Together we shall dramas trace,<br>
I’ll cry or sleep in your embrace.<br>
<br>
At restaurants with plates piled high,<br>
Two-thirds are yours—don’t ask me why.<br>
<br>
Each month, I’ll play the pampered queen,<br>
Demanding kindness, soft and keen.<br>
You’ll stroke my hair, retrieve my needs,<br>
And love shall bloom like spring from seeds.<br>
<br>
I’ll towel your hair with gentle cheer,<br>
And press a kiss upon your ear.<br>
<br>
We’ll go where sea meets sky’s expanse,<br>
And pitch our tent beneath the dance<br>
Of stars that glimmer overhead—<br>
A quilt of night above our bed.<br>
<br>
We’ll cross the islands, roam and roam<br>
From tropic sands to mountains’ dome.<br>
Through Central Asia’s wondrous lands,<br>
With open hearts and laughing hands.<br>
<br>
At night I’ll look into your gaze,<br>
And whisper soft of all your days—<br>
“How was today, my love, my light?”<br>
Before we fade into the night.<br>
<br>
I’ll drop my bag, from travels long,<br>
And fly to you where I belong.<br>
My hands will find your jacket’s fold,<br>
A shelter warm against the cold.<br>
<br>
I’ll wear your shirt with loosened hair,<br>
And teasing, ask if I’m not fair.<br>
I’ll watch you work with thoughtful brow,<br>
And snap a photo, here and now.<br>
<br>
At dawn I’ll rise and fetch you grace—<br>
A glass of warmth, a soft embrace.<br>
I’ll comb your hair with fingers free,<br>
And wake you with a kiss from me.<br>
<br>
I’ll sing of love in melodies,<br>
In karaoke’s harmonies.<br>
<br>
Oh when I love, I do not part—<br>
I love with soul, with strength, with heart.<br>
No edge, no end, no guarded door—<br>
I love with all, and still want more.<br>
