I wrote a list of things I want to do in Indonesia; buy books in Gramedia, visit my best friends in Bandung, hangout with old friends in Solo and Sragen, visit my cousin in Semarang, plan a short getaway with mom in Karimunjawa, eat a lot of foods with Soto Girin as priority, do teeth bleaching, give my paper draft to my high school mentor, and so many more. There is one thing I can't quite picture, my first friend.<br>
<br>
As distance parts us after elementary school, we never really talk via online chat but we always find ways connecting face to face. As we grow older, I feel like I neglected the friendship, I didn't do check-ins. It gets weirder when suddenly the person that I care so much for had financial hardship, I was too reluctant to help her even though I know it must have been hard for her. I try to help through my mom, not directly, because I don't want her to owe me a penny. Yet, I feel like I didn't do enough. I have this icky feeling that she is cutting me off. And it breaks my heart.<br>
<br>
She is my first friend in the world. We have a picture of us taken when we're about 2 years old where we sat on my parent's kitchen bench. She was crying, and I was looking at her. We wore cute hats and pretty dresses. Now that she cries again, I'm still looking at her, doing nothing.<br>

*Hi, how are you lately? I'm sorry I didn't reply to your texts, I'm sorry that the world is treating you very badly, I'm sorry that you have a heavy responsibility to your family, I'm sorry that I have been a bad friend, I'm sorry. I know that nothing I say will ever ease your pain. I'm sorry that I'm apologizing partly to feel better, and again, being selfish. I'm sorry.*
