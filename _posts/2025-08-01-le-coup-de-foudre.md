It was drizzling. One fine rainy day in the whole week of scorching hot days. I was up until 3 am last night, summer nights are too short. Sleeping at 3 am has its own perks. I don't have to be awake at 4 am, feeling tired and unfocused to do the morning prayer. I get to feel the 3 am redemption, a quiet moment where the world feels most peaceful and as if all my sins could be washed away. My circadian rhythm is extremely messy. I hate sleeping after midnight but lately I'm always home at 10 or 11 pm, except today. Today I was supposed to be home after midnight. However, I discontinued my scheduled measurement because my colleague’s took too long to finish. I consider it luck, until I took the Yamanote line just before the rush hour. Ah, Tokyo.<br>
<br>
I haven't called mom for two weeks. I am too busy on the weekdays and she is too busy on the weekends. “Take care of your health”, she texted. I replied with the typical template, “Of course I will”, when I actually wanted to say, “I want to go home”. Sometimes, only sometimes, while walking through the windy subway platform in Asakusa after work, I am wondering, “What is a home?”. Not that I don't literally and philosophically understand the concept, “What is my home?”. I haven’t been able to find an answer to this question. I would then hear a voice inside my head, “Do you let yourself build it?”. Perhaps, I haven’t. Perhaps, I am not as brave as those who build theirs. Perhaps, I need a hand to build it with. Perhaps, I have it already, but I’ve never been there.<br>
<br>
“*Home is whenever I’m with you*”.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, I wonder how love could make my friends talk so long that I am sick of it, how love could physically hurts people, how love could change people entirely, how love could blind people that they are hanging by a thread, how love could make two people grow close quickly and apart easily, how *in the name of love* people are worshipping others.<br>
<br>
I knew love when I was at a classroom where I met this person who smiled brightly while saying his name. I didn’t even remember his name, until I gradually encountered this person in other occasions. I was so sure that I would keep the secret with me to my grave, until one morning when I decided to cut him loose. We were friends, good friends, until I said, “I am sorry, I don’t think we can be friends, it is too difficult for me”. I knew it was love when I unconsciously brought his name during my 3 am redemptions, not to ask for redemption but to wish him well. I never did that, bringing names to my favorite sacred moment.<br>
<br>
I don’t do that anymore.<br>
<br>
This person lets me experience all those madness in love. I love the way I immediately told him when something good happened to me. I love the way he did that too. I love the kind of person I was around him. I love how small the world was, that I encountered him several times a day, simply to smile and say hello. I love how happy I was seeing him grow as a person.<br>
<br>
*I love how I loved him*.<br>
<br>
Since then, the concept of *my home* becomes blurry. I don’t think I can ever stop loving him, the person he was. I let him occupy a tiny space in my heart because it was beautiful. He, the person he was, deserves to be there. For me, home was always about family and the place where I was born, until I met him. I didn’t know that I could find home in other people. “*It may happen again in the future*”, a hope that I keep telling myself with. Perhaps, I would mention a name during my 3 am redemptions again, asking God to keep this one better. Perhaps, the reserved space in my heart would not be empty.<br>
<br>
*Perhaps, one day, home would be a shared bookshelf. Or a child’s laugh. Or a shared sofa and blanket.*<br>
<br>
I was hoping to hear the sound of rain tonight, but it was just a drizzle. And I should be patiently waiting for the pouring rain.
