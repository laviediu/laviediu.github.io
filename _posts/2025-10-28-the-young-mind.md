"*Lovely to be sitting here with you*<br>
*You're kinda cute but it's raining harder*<br>
*My shoes are now full of water*<br>
*Lovely to be rained on with you*<br>
*It's kinda cute but it's so short*".<br>
<br>
<br>
This is a weird place, between excitement and anxiety, my world feels as peaceful as Shibuya crossing. I took a huge step last week, "I need a project, I want to sacrifice one thing for the other". I felt like, it is the answer I have been searching all along, becoming the truest version of myself, without being scared, without compromising, without putting myself smaller, without diminishing my dreams, with my smile and brain launching fireworks all over the sky.<br>
<br>
<br>
And yet, I found myself looking for a home, being nudged by an armrest and gentle poking. Probably it is hormonal, what do I know. Thus, let me just capture these moments, the room, the seats, the coffee, the book, the snack, the wet tissue.<br>
<br>
<br>
Today is the Youth Pledge Day. "But at the end of the day, everything comes back to love", I said to him. Forgetting the love for friends, family, and humanity. Love is universal and love is everywhere. Habibie wrote a letter for Indonesia when he was dying. Marie Curie passed due to radiation exposure. Everything is indeed coming back to love, and romantic love is *one* of those.<br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps, it is the pressure of growing older, the attempt to be matched with some strangers, the longing for romantic partnership, the hormonal changes, the inevitable fate of human's need for procreation.<br>
<br>
<br>
And, so, God, let me enjoy my youth, let me fly so high after falling too deep, let me feel all the tinglings and silly giggles, let me write my own story, let me live my fate the best way I could.
