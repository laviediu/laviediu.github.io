I hear a melody outside the window<br>
Snow is not falling in October,<br>
yet the chills run through bones<br>
I open the window,<br>
and a firewood warms my red cheeks<br>
It is your shadow I found<br>
<br>
My mind wanders to the deep dark sky<br>
My hand seeks a page where your name was sewn<br>
I demand a miracle, an answer,<br>
a verse elaborating the dreams of your presence<br>
It is I,
who am lost in your steady eyes<br>
<br>
The eyes I forgot,<br>
ignored,<br>
lost,<br>
yet always returned<br>
<br>
*It is the thing*<br>
*we love the most*<br>
*that destroys us*<br>
<br>
Here I beg,<br>
on bended knees,<br>
with an open wound,<br>
to once again believe<br>
in love<br>
