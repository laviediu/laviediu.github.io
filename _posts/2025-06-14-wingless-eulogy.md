to the broken ones<br>
to those without wings<br>
to the ones picking up grains<br>
of their ashes<br>
<br>
here's our celebration<br>
let the dam bursts,<br>
the glass shatters,<br>
the pouring rain waters<br>
our gray souls<br>
<br>
hear hear<br>
tomorrow is a new day<br>
our souls may darken<br>
or lighten<br>
white is lame<br>
black is the new blue<br>
<br>
hear hear<br>
i'm with you.
