> “My lady, wilt thou be mine?”<br>
> So asked the prince, his voice a thread of silk.<br>
<br>
> *“Very well, my prince,”* she answered with grace,<br>
> *“Let us build a kingdom grand.”*

Eight winters passed, and lo—the palace once promised now stood a weather-worn cottage. Not by alchemy nor legacy did it endure, but by the quiet burden of her labor. <br>

> “My lady,” said he once more, <br>
> “wilt thou be the spine that keeps me tall?”<br>
<br>
> *“How could I?”* she whispered,<br>
> *“These bones have bowed beneath our roof.”*<br>
<br>
> “Then help me rise, <br>
> for my knees are chained by demons I cannot name.”<br>
<br>
> *“Alas, my prince,”* she murmured, <br>
> *“these feet were lost upon the road that warmed thy sleep.”*
