*Stupid, stupid, stupid.*<br> 
<br>
I wanted to curse but that would just make my mouth dirtier. I have so many things on my plate right now, I live thousand miles from my home country, yet the things that happened there is always on my mind. Is it because my parents and grandparents live there? Not only because of that. I have this sense of belonging to the community since I was very little, my home country is not about who governs it but always about the community.<br>
<br>
I mean, *what the hell*. How do people up there govern and make better decisions?! Sometimes, frustration feels like a useless act, it *is*, because I don't contribute there. Though, sometimes, frustrations are the source of impact.<br>
<br>
Even when good people are entering, what I see is (mostly) them either being crushed by or following the system, rather than fixing what's left to fix.<br>
<br>
How could *we* fix it? <br>
What should *I* do? <br>
Starting small feels meaningless, <br>
starting big seems drowning in the dirty flow.<br>
<br>
Ugh, it is a cycle of never ending misery. No, Taylor, this is *not* me trying, *this is me cursing*.
