oh love<br>
then i remember my deadlines,<br>
my delayed personal projects,<br>
the courses i want to finish by the weekend,<br>
hundreds of experiments i desperately want to try.<br>
<br>
love?<br>
seriously, they say love should be easy<br>
fluff it, you lucky people!<br>
my folks hate it,<br>
they are confused by its dopamine and depression.<br>
<br>
ah.. love?!<br>
love is by far, a delusion<br>
an idealization of a person <br>
that, me too was idealized and i fiercely am against it<br>
i ask myself again, and again<br>
~~do you need love?~~<br>
strike that, false question<br>
do you *feel* love?<br>
<br>
love?<br>
i have done my part of being unreciprocated, dismissed,<br>
and also, loved, thank *you* for that,<br>
but to *deliberately* love? *and* be loved,<br>
boy oh boy.<br>
<br>
one thing i remind myself,<br>
when drowning in the ocean of hormones and just.. being human<br>
can you afford it?<br>
are you ready for the bigger question?<br>
is he the one you need when your mom leaves you alone on Earth, miserably?<br>
love???<br>
