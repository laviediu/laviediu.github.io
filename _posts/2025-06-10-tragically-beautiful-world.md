Perhaps it was me<br>
who wanted to live short<br>
who aimed too grand<br>
who had no voice<br>
who was unbothered<br>
who questioned everything<br>
<br>
Perhaps it was human<br>
who lived for too long<br>
who lived recklessly<br>
who lived for empty words<br>
who lived for meaningless gain<br>
who lived only to survive<br>
<br>
Perhaps it was the world<br>
which was tragically beautiful<br>
which enticed its inhabitants<br>
which shamelessly offered life<br>
