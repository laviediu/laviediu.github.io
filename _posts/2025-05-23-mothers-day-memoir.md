her two feet crossed oceans<br>
her two hands drove a boat against Pacific<br>
her mind is travelling through six dimensions<br>
her heart is beating loud as Chopin's classic<br>
<br>
courage is not given, but imprinted<br>
resilience is not built, but earned<br>
independence is not seek, but constructed<br>
but her love and warmth are taught<br>
<br>
no man can define, she won't let them<br>
no man can destroy, she won't buckle<br>
no man can possess, she owns herself<br>
no man can trespass, she guards the gate<br>
<br>
the crown is for her mother<br>
all hail to the laborer<br>
she holds dearly closer<br>
until the God takes her<br>
<br>
what a man may offer, she prompted<br>
how a man be a lover, she urged<br>
why a man must hold all together,<br>
when a lady is there as foundation<br>
where a lady is present as a mother<br>
