her two feet crossed oceans
her two hands drove boat against Pacific
her mind is travelling through six dimensions
her heart is beating loud as Chopin's classic

courage is not given, but imprinted
resilience is not built, but earned
independence is not seek, but constructed
but her love and warmth are taught

no man can define, she won't let them
no man can destroy, she won't buckle
no man can possess, she owns herself
no man can trespass, she guards the gate

the crown is for her mother
all hail to the laborer
she holds dearly closer
until the God takes her

what a man may offer, she prompted
how a man be a lover, she urged
why a man must hold all together,
when a lady is there as foundation
where a lady is present as a mother
