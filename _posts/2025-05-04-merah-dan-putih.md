Red symbolizes courage, dynamism, leadership, and confidence, while <br>
white represents purity, truth, and safety.<br>
<br>
This nation I hold so dearly<br>
—a land where dreams once written on the walls of my rented room were boldly cast into the future—<br>
has grown tired.<br>
<br>
Weary from the cries of millions seeking justice. <br>
Weary from decisions that corrode its body. <br>
Weary from great serpents that bind its legs<br>
—so it cannot stand, <br>
let alone run.<br>
<br>
A single great kingdom has risen on its back, unaware that countless smaller kingdoms do the same, <br>
everywhere.<br>
<br>
And why wouldn’t they? It is the nature of humankind—of every person, <br>
without exception.<br>
<br>
Yet when the country I love stands on the edge—<br>
its mind to be wiped, <br>
its mouth to be silenced, <br>
its throat to be choked, <br>
its heart to be shot<br>
then the sobs begin to sound like screams. <br>
<br>
The snakes that once only coiled now show their fangs and venom. <br>
The decisions that once felt distant now appear before our very eyes.<br>
<br>
Red and white<br>
—this nation is weary. <br>
Its body needs every soul to help it rise, <br>
to stand tall, <br>
to walk, <br>
and <br>
to run.<br>
<br>
So the question is;<br>
where do we begin? <br>
We begin now. <br>
We begin anywhere. <br>
We begin with anyone who is willing.<br>
<br>
Some say love must always be reciprocated. <br>
But what nation are they seeing?<br>
<br>
Perhaps all they see is the rot—<br>
disease eating away at its body.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the land I once saw with my own eyes<br>
—a nation of <br>
vast fertile soil, <br>
clean flowing water, and <br>
calm, cooling dawn air<br>
—is no longer there.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is I <br>
who am too deeply tethered to my love for this country.<br>
<br>
And yet, <br>
I believe<br>
—I am not alone. <br>
I believe I have comrades who feel the same.<br>
<br>
I do not wish to judge them. <br>
I will not tear further into the heart of a nation already worn and weary.<br>
<br>
But I do wish<br>
—in my own way—<br>
to extend this trembling hand of mine<br> 
to help it rise.<br>
To heal the wounds of its body and spirit. <br>
To walk beside it, step by step. <br>
To cheer, <br>
“You can do it! No need to rush—I’m already proud!” <br>
as it dares to run its very first race.<br>
<br>
So what about you, my friend? <br>
Shall we join hands and do this together? <br>
In our own unique ways, of course.<br>
