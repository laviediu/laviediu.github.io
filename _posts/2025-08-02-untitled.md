tingling slush of electricity in the skin<br>
thoughts racing through the crisp air<br>
one two three, a breath was taken away<br>
<br>
i walked through a garden of gypsophila<br>
would there be one white lily?<br>
perhaps the painter of flowers and leaves grew one<br>
<br>
the breezy wind caught my gown<br>
the calming sunlight bathed my cheeks<br>
i smiled, my hands were holding the white lily<br>
<br>
welcome.<br>
