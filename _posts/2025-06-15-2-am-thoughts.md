This one is going to be super raw, I like to see blood on my plates. It is half past one in the morning. I just hung up a call with my friends, the first call was startup discussion, the second was girl thing-y I love. I kept putting off something I wanted to do and now I am doing it. I didn't expect that I would be this heartbroken, slow-burn-ly, while reading a letter. A letter that probably waited for almost 5 years. A closore I didn't know I needed, from my side, as well. My battery is running low but I left my charger at the meeting room, because guess who had part time job at the university today. <br>
<br>
Yet, I think God has given me numerous, yes *that* much, closures I desperately needed this year. From me cursing someone who made me cry *in the middle of* experiments---I don't curse at people! And I still hate you for treating me like that, letting go the one I adore---so much, to being *brutally* honest to someone I've always felt safe with. Like Taylor said,<br>
<br>
*"I cry a lot but I am so productive, it's an art"*<br>
<br>
*"you know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart"*<br>
<br>
So this is what it takes to be 25 (read: almost 30); heartbreak anniversaries, trauma recognitions, covering wounds with smiles. I am super excited to start my new job next week, *whilst* having my heart wrenched again and again. Honestly, I was so done with all these and desperately asked God to let me fall so bad that I could understand what is going on. God answered that, and now I am the one kneeling---both for feeling grateful and finally understanding the tragedy. What a breakthrough you smart gal!<br>
<br>
I want to go to my favorite beach in Tokyo, or camp under Tokyo sky, or hike Takao---the most beginner friendly mountain, or run at my favorite park. Now I understand why one of my friends went hiking after she decided to end her situationship. I am so far from being in anything serious right now, I can see myself being single and running for a marathon before submitting my dissertation. You should find me funny, I aspire to be a stand-up comedian if I couldn't get my PhD. Laugh. <br>
<br>
This is a call, please don't disturb my peace, anyone. Don't blame me if my replies sound cold either, I'm sure you are a great person.<br>
<br>
I hate that I completely forgot to take my charger. So, did you enjoy the steak rare? Or should I make rendang as how I cooked my poems?
