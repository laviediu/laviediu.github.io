It has been a long time, 2 weeks without writing is long enough I guess. I stayed at my friend's last weekend, it was revolutionary. Yes. You see, I spend most of my time either at the university lab or company lab, my interactions are limited to work-based ones with colleagues. Somehow I felt there was a cloud on top of my head, lingering and following my steps everywhere I go, until I spent a Friday night hanging out with a friend and staying at her place until the next evening. Little did I know, I have a new sleeping habit, not to be proud of. Haha. <br>
<br>
We had the science camp (literally, I was helping her to derive the diffusion-reaction equation in a sphere with bacteria cells inside, ah good day to be back to calculus, what a proud engineering student moment lol). Of course we didn't spend the night only for a science camp! Though it was a highlight of my week, because I spent the rest of the long weekend finishing my progress report and barely had enough sleep. We cooked, no, I cooked! Well it was fried rice, but that's a start right?! We watched Keira Knightley's recent movie, something about cabin number 10 in a cruise, a good mystery drama genre. We had the pillow talk, you know, the ones where we reminisce the old days before we decided to take a PhD :) <br>
<br>
I also had a call and made new friends with my friend's friends. They are giggly, and I love every bit of it! I understand why loneliness kills people. It does. One thing I learned today is that it is unbelievable how people don't bring their work back home, because I almost always do. In fact, I just bought 90 cm x 180 cm whiteboard for my wall from Amazon today. I also have a dream that if someday I own a house, I'd like to dedicate a room with its entire wall fully furnished as a whiteboard! Imagine having all your ideas written in the wall! How exciting is that! Yeah I read that, I *am* weird. I guess, some people are just as passionate as me with their work and adulting is realizing that maybe that's okay, as long as it doesn't ruin your sanity haha.<br>
<br>
I *am* cheer-y today, that's my cue to leave for bed! Au revoir.
