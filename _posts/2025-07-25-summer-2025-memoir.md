I just finished my dinner, a ripe banana and a piece of roasted English muffin, sandwiched to a slice of cheese with honey and Ceres chocolate sprinkles topping. I usually eat this assortment for my breakfast. Since I went to the university today, I had a bit of time to whip up a pasta in the morning. This week's heat peaks at 37 degrees which I hope August won't top it to 40, the humidity is crazy too. I always check my weather app ever since I live in Japan, though the app doesn't seem to tell me useful predictions whenever I'm back home in Indonesia. I haven't been writing anything for the past two weeks and my hand feels rusty, I hesitate a lot while typing.<br>
<br>
We have a marine day that took place last weekend, giving me a chance to reconnect with friends and spend a whole day without working, at all. Eight of us had a Sunday night fun at the nearby karaoke place. I was screaming at the top of my lungs while standing in front of the screen when *Shut Up and Dance* was played. I requested this song after *Too Sweet*. These two are my must-sing-list every time we hit the karaoke place. Suddenly, I became a lead singer who held a fantastic concert with only seven audiences. I was Chris Martin and all my friends were front row concertgoers. The night was still young, yet I lost half of my energy. I ended up looking like a drunk lady when we're back home at around 1 am. I didn't even drink soda, I had a cup of hot chocolate!<br>
<br>
A day before, I went to a book sale in Shinjuku with a friend. Nothing caught my attention even after going over a dozen of boxes for an hour. In the end, ten minutes before the store closed, I was holding a non-fiction about the world after AI and was about to pay for it. Just 2 meters before the counter, I saw Jacinda Ardern's latest book, "A Different Kind of Power", and I immediately tell my friend to help me return the book that I was going to buy in exchange for Jacinda's. The book was actually sitting on my Amazon cart for weeks because the price cuts my pocket deeper than any other books that I purchased. When I saw the book standing there, I went with my instinct, "Whatever, I know I'm going to read this immediately and leave all those three books about cognitive biases". And I was right. I can't stop reading it during the two hour commute for my summer internship. The book is very warm that I occasionally tilt my head back to prevent my tears from falling in public. It reminds me a lot to the place where I grew up, the friends that I had, my grandpa, and my mom.<br>
<br>
I don't exactly remember how I spent the summer of 2024. Looking from old texts, I was writing my thesis around this time. It turned out that I was still doing my experiment while writing my first chapter, which then will be moved to chapter 2 and leaving chapter 1 for an overview. In July 1st, I was bored, much like what I felt about a month ago when I thought, "This paper revision is driving me insane, I have been going over multiple revisions with weeks of redoing microstructural observation, it is super boring and frustrating", without knowing that later I would be very proficient in operating the electron microscope facility in the lab, and that I would need to rewrite a whole new paper because we decided to have a joint paper with Oxford. Also, without knowing that I would see a summer internship job posting and submit an application anyway. Take a peek at my texts below.<br>

*[2024/07/23, 19:34:18] ayukaryana: We're so screwed*<br>
<br>
Similar to the summer of 2025, this day a year ago, the heat was also the problem, the moment when all summer madness began.<br> 
<br>
*[2024/07/25, 20:30:44] xxxxxx: Which chapter are you on rn*<br>
*[2024/07/25, 20:31:27] ayukaryana: Second to last chapter, idk I got stuck because of the heat*<br>
*[2024/07/25, 20:31:36] ayukaryana: It's so damn hot today*<br>
<br>
That was the madness before I received an email that made my supervisor looked so sad in the office. To be fair, after knowing that my first fellowship application was rejected, with a grade similar to those of my undergraduate sport course grade, I cried for a week, during daily prayers and when I got home from school. It was too gloomy. I didn't want to have a career break at the time. It seems a bit overly dramatic now, but the announcement was the hardest rejection I received that year after being rejected by several other opportunities. It was definitely worse than my first true heartbreak when I cried for three nights in a row. A week after the fellowship rejection, the last opportunity that I seized was announced, another fellowship application to a different agency, I received a minimal feedback and congratulatory message. My supervisor immediately sent the following email.<br>
<br>
*Dear Ayu-san,*<br>
*Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*<br>
<br>
Grateful is an understatement. If I didn't get the fellowship, it means that I would not continue my research and that I would drop out from graduate school, returning back home jobless. It also means that the risky move I made to reject my scholarship extension from master's to doctoral degree was partly idiotic, because I didn't prepare thoroughly. At the time, it felt like my world would collapse. My mom and dad's business went down because of the pandemic. Going home means that we are all screwed. Yet, the poorly executed decision braced myself to do more challenging stuff later on.<br>
<br>
This summer, during the first few weeks of my internship, I was able to experience sleep deprivation again after a while. It humbled me. I mostly spent my two hour commute to read technical documentations and brainstorm ideas. Lately, I am able to use the commute fully to relax by reading non-fictions. In the winter of 2024, a researcher that I'm working with offered a research project with over 100 hours commitment. I was able to save more. I decided to treat myself a little by enjoying a brief holiday in Singapore and Indonesia. The work itself was somewhat demanding, with late night and weekend working hours, because I was juggling experiments in the middle. Later, I knew that the researcher is seizing her few years at the university before retirement. One night, she opened up and I couldn't stop tears from flowing down through my cold cheeks when I finally know that she has been battling with cancer. We shed tears and hugged, she said to me, "It is okay, I am okay". I went home at around 10 pm and I couldn't help myself to stop the tears from falling even more intense when I entered my room. She is someone that makes Tokyo warmer and prettier.<br>
<br>
Looking back, I never had a period where I was doing nothing. Once, I had a very uneventful holiday break from the university, probably it was my freshman year, and I was bored to death. It is not because unemployment worries me (well of course it is), but because I feel like my limited time on Earth is too precious to be spent not doing meaningful things, a personal project at the very least is better than laying on the sofa for hours. I don't really enjoy going out, homebody is an eternal condition. Most of the time, I see work as something that I contribute to society's progress, whether it is directly or indirectly. It is also an outlet to let myself experience numerous things I never tried, as a homebody. <br>
<br>
I think I am partly influenced by my mom. I never truly understood how she felt when I was a teenager, I only know that she worked a lot since I was still very little. She is a high school graduate, majoring in administration if I'm not mistaken. She has five brothers and was married right after she finished her school. She was about to go to Jakarta, following two of her brothers before my dad proposed. She had me when she was about twenty years old. We do look like sisters rather than mother and daughter. She has been a businesswoman, starting with clothing, then restaurant, and now beverages. I am always surprised by how well she can talk with people, she kept hundreds of contact in her phone, a huge contrast to myself who only keeps a dozen of contact. She started to work part time at the local government body and healthcare facility, with the work swallowing most of her time, yet generating much lower wage in comparison to her business. She once said to me, "Not many people want to do the work that I do, especially with this rate of wage, but I love the work that I do for people here". I always enjoy hearing her stories about the elderly at the clinic, the workshops at the local office, the surveys that she need to fill by going to hundreds of homes, the short vacation with her friends. I could see that she is much happier. The one thing that I couldn't forget is the way she rode a motorbike with its seat full of clothes, all the way from Klewer traditional market in Surakarta to my home in Sragen. She did that when I was in elementary school. It helped my dad to build a family of one daughter not missing the education she needs.<br>
<br>
I could say that I was a high maintenance kid in my neighborhood, more than my friends. I was the first to own a computer, but we would just use it to play Plants vs Zombie, Zuma, Feeding Frenzy, Solitaire, and Minesweeper. My parents didn't set up an internet at home, thus I only use the computer for school work or playing games. At the time, my math teacher was also my IT teacher. I enjoyed every *experiment* that we had in the computer lab, mostly understanding how to type various fonts in Microsoft Word. I was also the one who goes to, at the time, an acclaimed *International Standard School Pilot*. In elementary school, I participated in a lot of science competitions and one singing competition, with the latter went very wrong. I also enjoyed every fine art class, I liked sketching and I had good grades most of the time, though I didn't draw much later in middle school. The teacher was auditioning for a singing contest, each student was asked to go in front of the class to sing any song that they want. At the time, I picked Yovie and Nuno's *Janji Suci*, because my uncle and aunt liked the song so much. One thing that the teacher didn't calculate was how different my voice would be when I sing a song that match my pitch versus national songs that are bright and motivational. My voice cracked in the middle of the contest. I was very ashamed during the Monday ceremony where every single of my friends who were selected received awards, while I was just standing from afar trying to erase the horrible memory from my head. Around fifth grade, I participated in a math olympiad where I went to a fancy school, that was later demolished. From that moment on, I was very sure that I wanted to go there for middle school. Little did I know, the school only accepted boys. I was crushed, but not too crushed because for such a fancy school I would need to ask too high tuition fee to my parents.<br>
<br>
At that time, enrolling to a so-called *favorite* public school required me to take written exams. I went to the city center where the school is located, and did my best to answer the questions. Yet, I couldn't answer much of the essay questions. It was too difficult for me. Apparently, being top students in the small village where I lived weren't enough. But perhaps, I wasn't alone, I did get accepted to the school. My first day was very bad, I sat quite far away from the whiteboard, I don't know anyone there, I had a surprise math exam that I couldn't answer. It was not because I didn't know how to answer it, but because it was too blurry for me. I think I cried when I got home. It was the time when I know I had a myopia. I gradually made new friends, with some are still close to me until now. My father always refused to take me to school with motorbike, except when I got up very late (which was almost never), or when he needed to go to the town. I would ride my bike from home at 5.30, put it at the bike deposit counter, then take the public transportation, an overloaded Suzuki Carry, the journey took about 30 minutes and I would arrive right in front of the school before 7 am. I made new friends from other schools in the town from this arrangement. I also grew close with some friends from my own school. Still, my two female best friends went to the nearby school, while my two male best friends went to school in town. This would later make us grow apart. We were practically inseparable, the five of us always studied together in my house every night. I always hangout with one of my female best friends whenever I'm home. Only three of us went to university. The boys are all married by now. Two of us work in a factory near my hometown. One has very cute twins.<br>
<br>
In high school, I went to the city in Surakarta. Yet again, none of my middle school best friends went there. I soon made friends by joining two clubs, photography and science clubs. I was staying in a boarding house with other female students, some of them were my middle school friends. It was the first time I entered a cinema as there was no cinema in town, up until now. I bet both my parents never go to a cinema. After I was allowed to have a motorbike license, I brought a motorbike to the boarding home and would go home every weekend. I would get back in early Monday morning. At the time, my dad saw the opportunity to pick me up every weekend while doing a business, selling fresh corns from a big traditional market in Surakarta to people in my hometown. I didn't need to go home by myself and I occasionally asked dad to treat me to a restaurant or Wedang Ronde stall. I would talk non-sense or sometimes bringing up political issues during the car ride home. I liked the Monday morning ride where most of the time dad would take his motorbike instead of car because of the traffic. I like how fast and how good he was in doing maneuvers. When I was little, I remember learning to ride a bike for the whole day, I fell too much, I got bruise everywhere and some of the scars remain. When I got a little older, I fell once with motorbike, my dad and I also fell once when I was in middle school. Luckily, it was a relatively slow day. The road from my town to the city is a big road for inter-province buses and trucks, and thus being slow would bother others. With this, I grew to love riding motorbike, fast. Road is a thing that bridge us.<br>
<br>
For the first time in forever, I saw my dad fell sick. He was hospitalized. I was still an undergraduate student at the time. It felt very strange that a strong man like him lying in a hospital bed. It took him quite long to recover. Since then, my mom became even more stronger. Right then, I understand what it means to be a woman and a wife, more than ever. My parents' marriage is not perfect, there were times when they had too many arguments and silent treatments when I was young. They married in their early twenties, with dad being five years older than mom. I also learned a lot of what could go wrong in a marriage from a very young age. It is honestly both torture and lessons. As I grow older, I understood more things that I didn't understand back then. It was never perfect, but I am beyond grateful that they gave me a perfect little life. A life that leads me to spend a summer of 2025 as a graduate school student pursuing her dreams.<br>

It has been five hours of writing, I need to go to school tomorrow, I guess this is a good exercise after not scribbling anything for the past two weeks.
