It has been a while, I wrote an unpublished draft titled "through the dark", it is very depressing haha. I wasn't in a very good place, but I felt better after finally talking to my mom. She basically told me to turn to Allah and seek refuge, and guess what, that's exactly what I need. I almost forget how wholesome talking to Allah at ~3 am feels. It is as if He was right in front of where I was standing, talking back to me, asking me, "what happens? why are you sad? I am here".<br>
<br>
I guess it's time for a brief life update. I've been cooking, a lot. I've been using my new chopper for processing a large batch of white and red onions (two of the most important spices in Indonesian dishes) for the last two weekends. I would sauté these ingredients in cooking oil, then put them in small boxes to be kept in the freezer. I also did the same for the red and green chili. The system works very well! This way, I can cook in under 30 minutes every day. I love to cook new recipes, though mostly they're adjustment from my mom's. It's still far from her level, but I'm trying my best! :). Sadly though, even if I already have blueberries, bananas, yoghurt, and the perfect recipe for a gluten-free banana bread (oat flour is the secret!), I haven't been able to bake :(. This is my project for the weekend, period!!!<br>
<br>
And hey, I had a meeting with the Oxford collaborators! It was super thrilling because I need to kind of lead the meeting (I know!) and at the same time make our arguments stand. Alhamdulillah, it went well, I feel like I have 3 supervisors lol, two from Oxford and one from TUAT. Oh look at how Allah turned my dreams into reality. I did want to apply for the Jardine foundation scholarship exactly at my collaborator's lab hahaha. And the way it turned out is sooooo much better.<br>
<br>
I really miss my grandma and my parents, and my cats (how many kittens are there now?!). I was planning a surprise "*mudik*", but that would cause a lot of troubles for myself. First, the new airport is apparently quite remote and I need to take a train to reach my hometown, and then I still need to take a "*gocar*" from the station to my home. What a mess!!! I would most likely be too tired because I'll have a trasfer in Singapore for a day before landing in Yogyakarta the next morning.<br>
<br>
"Are you really not going home?", she asked.<br>
"Surprise! I'll be back in the last day of Ramadan (probably)".<br>
"Your grandma would be very happy!".<br>
"I was going to surpise you all but then I won't have a free lift!".<br>
<br>
Also, I think I've got a crush. It's been quite a while, but I'm just happy that I get to feel the butterflies without acting upon it, hehe. I just take it that Allah sends this person, who's very much alike to my type, to let me know that there is nothing impossible in His hand. That I can ask anything to Him without thinking it's too much or too impossible!<br>
<br>
I won't see this person again in 5 months (most likely), but I already feel enough to get to know him. He is a very kind gentleman! You know, this is the type in which you wish your crush will be happy with the best person whomever he'll end up with. And wish that Allah will give a lot of mercy and blessing towards him in the future :)<br>
<br>
I can't wait to go home, and spend a day in Singapore again! See you in the next lovely memento. *Goedeavond en welterusten!*<br>
