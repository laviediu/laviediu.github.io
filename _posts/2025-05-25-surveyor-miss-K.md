One week I spent from a sunny night,<br>
equal to throwing this soul into burning pit.<br>
Surfing, drowning, rescuing at my own expense.<br>
<br>
I intoxicated my soul a liquor made of your charms.<br>
I met your mind a day and my life is magnanimously shaken.<br>
<br>
My dictionary was full of storms and mundanes,<br>
it turned into Kafkaâ€™s final.<br>
I am miss K, <br>
a surveyor of unknown land <br>
surveying your beautiful mess in the castle.<br>
A castle I wish to enter, <br>
yet our riddle intercourse leads me to snowy path my legs are broken.<br>
<br>
Lord lord lord, my diary is full.<br>
<br>
Do not reveal your soul nor body <br>
as my time is irreversible.<br>
The rose thorns slit, <br>
the shade ghost, <br>
I drunk myself into the sea of your honors.<br>
