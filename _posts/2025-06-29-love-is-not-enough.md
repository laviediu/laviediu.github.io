I may delete this post from the site, keeping it archived in my local folders, then realizing several years later that I wrote this. I tend to do that when I feel over-exposed to the world, it gives me an ick. I am sober, meaning that I am definitely not sleep-deprived nor unrelaxed. I spent half an hour sitting on a bench at the university under the moonlight, gazing at the stars while reading The Black Swan. Thus, this memento is written in a full state of sanity of the writer. But again, I might delete it from the public.<br>

*If love was ever enough, I would go to you, slowly, steadily, like how the leaves fall in autumn. If love was enough, I would let you to love me entirely, without waiting for years. If love was enough, I would let us love, argue, then reconcile. If love was ever enough, I would write every single thing that made me fall in love with you. If love was enough, I would never ask you to let me go. If love was enough, I would hold your hand like there was storm coming to us. If love was ever enough, I would let myself to express my disappointment and let you treat me better. If love was enough, I would come to you whenever life gets too difficult. If love was enough, you would never wonder whether your feelings are reciprocated. If love was ever enough, if life was ever ideal, I would let you choose me for however messy I am. And if love was ever enough, I would run to you and say, "tell me your story like that night, how are you feeling now?".*<br>

Yet, love was never enough. Perhaps, we boarded the same train that day, the same flight that night, but our destinations may never, from the start, be similar. And maybe that's enough for us. You will outgrow me eventually, and I will outgrow you. And I can't help but wonder, is this The Black Swan in your life too?
