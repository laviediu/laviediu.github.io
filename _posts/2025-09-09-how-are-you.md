Hi, it has been a while, and this, is for you. I have been hurt, and I too, have hurt a lot of people. I never apologized to you, did I? But this is not a letter of apologies, this is a letter showing how much a friend you meant to me.<br>
<br>
The world is a scary and cold place, isn't it? I can see it clearly in your eyes, the way you see things. You are one of the strongest person I've ever met in my life. I don't know what you saw in me, but thank you for seeing the good things in me.<br>
<br>
I don't believe that a person needs other people to rescue themselves. And I believe that you have done the rescuing, to yourself, very well. I did a lot of stupid things, like the day when I should have told you, "hey, let's discuss about your feelings", rather than sending my letter. I was not a teenager, but I could have done better than that.<br>
<br>
I should have asked you to meet me in a caf√©. I should have asked, "how are you?". I should have let you talk more clearly, not in a one-sentence outburst. I should have let you finish your coffee or cigarettes. I should have been a better friend.<br>
<br>
We were good friends. I miss that, but I know it is best to keep it this way. For as much as I want to know how you are doing, I feel like I will always hurt you when I do more, and so I stop.<br>
<br>
That night, I cried my eyes out, because I know how hard it must be for you. And I know that I couldn't be there for you, as much as I tried to be. And you don't need to tell me, I can see all the pains in your eyes.<br>
<br>
I am a coward. A coward for not being a better friend for you, a coward for not telling you how strong and brave you are, a coward for faking to not care how you are doing, a coward for keeping this letter unsent.<br>
<br>
You, you are never a small part in my twenties. I want to sit next to you and tell you that you are going to be okay, that you are going to live a wonderful life, that you are going to conquer the world and live your dreams, but I hope someone better than me will do that to you instead. You are never not a good part of my life, and I hope I was not a bad part of yours. I hope you will do well in everything that you will do, wherever you are, I am sure you know it best. I am sorry for writing this now, and not years ago.<br>
<br>
Hi, I wish you are doing well, with or without the cigarettes.
