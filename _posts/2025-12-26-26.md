December 26th, 2025, I am 26.<br>
<br>
Being 26, I can barely remember whether it is 25 or 26. It doesn't even matter anymore, except that the number brings wisdom and the excuse to choose peace. To shush all the noisy voices, the urge to keep performing, the necessity to be witnessed. To live gratefully and proudly as my own authentic self.<br>
<br>
What a woman wants? She wants to be left alone.<br>
<br>
Leaving all pieces of broken shatters behind is how I would sum up 2025.<br>
<br>
I keep deleting the words I wrote while listening to beautiful voices and humming along. I guess there's nothing left to be written.<br>
<br>
I am not wishing for sunshines and rainbows in 2026. I will be fine even if the rain pours, as the sound of raindrops will sit with my warm black tea.
