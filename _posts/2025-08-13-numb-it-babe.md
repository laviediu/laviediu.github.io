Activation energy. If only there is a catalyst to help me, oh right, there is a thing called numbness. How ridiculous it was that I felt like crap to the point where I questioned my existence and urging my isolation, until I dragged myself to the lab for 2 hours just to prepare an experiment, then feeling better. This was the draft I wrote this afternoon, very raw, very non-demure, very depressed-y.<br>
<br>
"*I hate long holiday break. Because I know that all my feelings that I have been avoiding will resurface again, and stab me in the most hurtful ways. I can't get myself up to work because I am already numb with deep cuts here and there. I wish I could scream "I am sick" as loud as I sang my heart out in the karaoke. I am tired of asking God, "What is wrong with me? help me, I don't want to be like this anymore". I hope I have the courage to pick up my phone and tell my mom that I have been suffering, instead of avoiding to call her. I wish I have the slightest hope that I would get better next year, or next decade, or ever. I wish I could feel less lonely despite my family and friends being around. I wish I could dim the feelings that I want to isolate myself until the day I die.*"<br>

I feel like I am one of those people they have in movies where the actor is all okay until sudden change disrupts the mundane life and things change forever. I always hate long break, and perhaps, perhaps that was why I hate career break. It was not because it is terrifying, but because I am hurting. I don't even know anymore which one is the true me, is it the one during the holiday break or is it the one during typical working period.<br>

This is not pretty. This is too much too ugly too vulnerable. But I am exhausted of pretending all okay when I am not. Now I know how to answer those interview questions where they asked me, "What are your weaknesses?". Well, do you think I would tell other people? I am an expert of numbing things, if that's even a word.<br>
