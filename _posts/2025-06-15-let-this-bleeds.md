I didn't know that love can be this gentle<br>
You love me in the black<br>
The love that sits with storms,<br> 
the one that keeps my bag from touching the floor<br>
<br>
I wear your patience<br>
like my brown jacket that warms throughout the whole winter<br>
You welcome my distance<br>
like my room that offers home<br>
<br>
Some people just aren't made for each other<br>
I was there, you were there, <br>
it was the most beautiful almost I had<br>
This is the kind that I will tell my son or daughter<br>
I keep a piece of you, you keep a piece of me<br>
And we're still a whole piece in our own without it<br>
<br>
*“It has been this way for some time”*<br>
Though our prayers won't cross<br>
Though I won't see your updates<br>
Though we won't make it<br>
I think I loved you, too<br>
And maybe that's enough for us<br>
<br>
I wish this could be easier for both of us<br>
We are two souls meeting halfway through a journey<br>
the one that has different destinations<br>
but there to show the next roads and turns<br>
<br>
It is a road that I'd look back,<br>
and say, *"thank you for everything"*.
