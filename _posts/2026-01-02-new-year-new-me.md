I woke up this morning forgetting that today is 2026. Haha. Uneventful? Yes. But it is the first day of 2026, I guess those new habit formations should be done again, hehe. I hope it lasts though. In the spirit of new year new me, today I start to take more control of my life and let life doesn't control me instead ("v"). Sadly, I still woke up at 10 am, yet having 12 hours of sleep lol. I struggled for a few days because I haven't had exercises, thus making my menstrual cramp feels like *hell*, believe me.<br>
<br>
I woke up feeling good and hungry, so I prepped a meal. I still had one small scoop of rice and a bag of vegetables, I guess I should call it fried vegetable instead :). This time, I took out my chopper and made the spices from scratch. Well, fried rice is simple, my chef-wannabe-friends wouldn't call it from scratch haha. It is a major improvement for me though. It was very delicious that I swear I won't put my chopper inside its box again.<br>
<br>
I continued the day with checking in my mom and friends. They all seem well, hopefully so. Although, I can sense that Mom was a bit sad because she spent the day working in her stall instead of going out somewhere nice. I said to her, I do the same, working, and it seems like she feels less lonely. One friend confessed that her phone is a source of toxic behaviors. Hahaha isn't that a bitter truth. In this society, phone could be an enemy, kid. And that's how I met my current self, by deactivating the most scandalous social media of all, Instagram. I will deactivate it again in two weeks. It was good though to be back after two months, I can still catch up with people and feel better about my decision.<br>
<br>
I proceed with tinkering my optimization script and fixing bugs here and there. Now I'm still executing the scripts. It seems like there are no hidden bugs anymore, I hope. If this works well, then I can continue to produce samples for training the model in real experiments. If I'm tempted by my supervisor's *nudge* to participate in a conference this March, then I'd probably catch my breath by the end of February. Let's hope that I'm not tempted.<br>
<br>
Before the new year holiday, my supervisor asked me to help a collaboration project and I was planning to do it this weekday, but instead I had three days off due to the hell of a menstrual cramp. I will probably do it this weekend, though it should be focused for my paper revision. I guess I need to finish my paper revision by tomorrow. Ugh. <br>
<br>
Anyway, *ik* start learning Dutch! You go *meisje*. Since I have an opportunity to study abroad, my supervisor and I have been thinking which university I should go to and which country is safest for me. Finally, we agree on the Netherland. Bye bye UK and Oxford! I reinstall my Duolingo and began my learning journey in Dutch today! I hope I'm committed hahaha. I search some internships too and it seems I found some good positions I should apply, probably need to polish my CV tomorrow though. You see, updating CV is such a bothersome task and I hate it very much! Also, making cover letters is not a picnic either.<br>
<br>
New year definitely new me! I need to sleep with these targets then. *Dag*! Whoops, i just realized that there are many similar Dutch and Indonesian words (*laugh in collonialism*).
