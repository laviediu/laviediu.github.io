Are you planning to stay,<br>
they asked.<br>
As if I have the answer,<br>
as if climate change is not inevitable.<br>
<br>
The door is open,<br>
yet I expect no one to come and return.<br>
<br>
The pain lingers in my skin, it itches,<br>
but scratching risks permanent damages.<br>
<br>
This is a foreign language,<br>
the one without dictionary to translate<br>
every suffering, joy, and in-between.<br>
<br>
If running, baking, traveling, hiking solved the puzzle,<br>
my hands would already be serving banana muffins on top of the Himalaya.<br>
<br>
I don't know what love is.<br>
Damn, Hozier was right.<br>
I fall in love just a little bit everyday with someone new.<br>
<br>
Adulting, it means<br>
I file my own taxes,<br>
track every expense,<br>
getting annoyed by irresponsible politicians.<br>
<br>
This is not a poem, it is a wasteland.<br>
I write because my heart contains, my head spills, my soul explodes.<br>
I long and ache for something inexplicable.<br>
They said life needs witness, someone to witness you,<br>
I say words witness existence,<br>
and God says the Earth witnesses them all.
