This memento is dedicated to myself who is currently snacking three types of snacks plus banana while listening to Lenka while writing a paper for conference proceedings while dancing a bit in the student's room. Remember this war! You enjoyed the two hours commute for reading, sure, it has helped you to unwind after work. And thank you for prioritizing sleep. This is the summer madness, again, much like the previous summer that was dedicated for thesis writing while fellowship hunting while crying every night. You need to remember this, especially this. Each summer has different stories. YES, LENKA, I DO WANT MY MONEY BACK, THE SHOW WAS NOT ENJOYABLE. And to the sweet Frenchman, yes, I need sweet words of affirmation, merci.
