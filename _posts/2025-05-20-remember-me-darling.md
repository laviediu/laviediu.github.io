Ah, there she goes again<br>
This is not the poem, I don’t care<br>
Opposite attract, the law, they said<br>
He loves mountains, she loves beaches<br>
He likes running, she likes writing<br>
Whatever, they are both passionate<br>
<br>
Ah, there she goes again<br>
Taylor’s love verses all over her days<br>
Even the birds are distracted by her smiles<br>
Is it love, is it a phase, she asked<br>
Everyone knows the answer<br>
She will break her heart, again<br>
<br>
Ah, there she goes again<br>
It feels different this time<br>
She is healed<br>
She takes it slow<br>
She brings it in her prayers<br>
Importantly, she’s working on herself<br>
<br>
Ah, there she goes again<br>
I wish she won’t end up crying a river<br>
I wish she is not the rule, but the exception<br>
I wish he is a good one, a wise man who knows how to court her<br>
I wish they are in love and sail the ship, through the mountains and beaches, together<br>
