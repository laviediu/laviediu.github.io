it was at the back of the old kindergarten building<br>
my first memory, were the pups your pet?<br>
the smile and twinkling eyes<br>
my friends would shush, telling me all about you<br>
<br>
would sleeping babies next to each other define a red string fate<br>
i am a rational believer, but more than science could offer<br>
<br>
why do i use more spices now?<br>
why am i not thinking of several exact plans?<br>
why do i ask myself which twisted parts might hurt a relationship?<br>
why am i changing?<br>
<br>
it is silly<br>
it has been a whole life<br>
what should i do?
