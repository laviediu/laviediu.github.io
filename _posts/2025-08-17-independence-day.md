I don't remember the last time I was home for independence day celebration. I just called mom, she couldn't hear my voice as she was participating in some games for the celebration. My grandma's yard was full of people, exactly like I pictured it would be. I couldn't help but wish I were there.<br>

My house always lit up several times in a year because Dad has become one of the community leaders. Perhaps, it has been more than 8 or even 10 years now, longer than a president's term. Though I'm not a fan of big crowd, I have never felt bothered by their presence. Living in a city for years makes me lonelier than ever. I am grateful that I still have friends who let me experience a sense of community belonging once in a while here. Yet, there is a hole in my heart where anything won't fit to fill in.<br>

Living in a countryside is not perfect. People are nosy of other's businesses. It is a tale of *Gilmore girls* or *Hometown Cha Cha Cha*. And yet, they are the first to be there when something happens. The communities thrive on small business and rice farming. As I grow older, I feel more concerned towards people's economy in my hometown. I see the world, the technology, the science, the politics, the economy. However, I couldn't see how all of those would reach the village. Some young people are leaving, just like what I do. I wonder whether they feel the way I do too. I couldn't understand *Rory* or *Hong Du Sik*'s point of view of their birthplace, but now I understand why they came back.<br>

*There's indeed no place like home*.
