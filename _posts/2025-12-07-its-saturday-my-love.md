Oh this is how a weekend should be spent! I just realized that I haven't had my real weekend since August, the one with real rest; calling loved ones, deep cleaning, watching romance TV series, and doing side projects. It is a small joy that I long for this whole time, a quality time with myself. My room is super tidy, I just cut my hair short (I've been telling myself since a month ago, "let's cut it this weekend"), and I (finally) hung the (presumably stickable) whiteboard that was delivered a week ago on the wall. Stupid me, the wall is rough, so I had to use my gecko glue instead. I hope it doesn't fall on me when I'm asleep, it's 90 times 180 cm or about the size of my bed! Haha. I want to write more but I understand how artists do their best during the worst. Thank you, next ;)
