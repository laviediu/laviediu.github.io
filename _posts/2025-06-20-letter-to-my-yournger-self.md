Hi, how are you? It is almost 12 am in Tokyo, I suppose you are already asleep now.
How is school? Are you riding a bike or motorcycle tomorrow? You will be sitting at that corner of *angkot* seat while letting the window opens, don't you?<br>
<br>
I will go to school tomorrow, it's Saturday I know. We are a PhD candidate!
I know right, you must be very proud. You're so cute, it's okay if you want to cry out of happiness.
By the way, I am still in contact with your close friends from middle school. I met them when I was in Indonesia 9 months ago. I live in Tokyo and have been here for almost 3 years! It is a dashing city indeed. I mostly avoid the crowded places though, and fortunately I am not in the center.
Do you remember that time when you bring your notebook to the bathroom? Maybe it hasn't happened yet, it's okay sweetheart you will ace the economics exam haha. You will meet several new people too, and your teacher will ask you to participate in an olympiad. It's okay if you don't make it to the next level, I am beyond proud with your efforts!<br>
<br>
Hey, thank you for always being passionate and staying curious. Most importantly, for staying true to yourself with your own colors. You will choose science over liberal arts in high school. Believe me, you won't regret the decision though you won't think much, will you? You will choose engineering physics out of all the interesting majors for college haha. Believe me, you won't regret it either, though again you won't think that much. You will ask lots of seniors from economics and engineering majors, but you will choose the *institute* at the end of the day. You will be bothered with a wastewater issue around your neighborhood, then spend almost 70% of your second year for experiments at the chemistry lab. It won't work, I am sorry honey, but I am very proud that you will present your ideas at a research competition. Also, for reading academic papers! Haha. <br>
<br>
You will write a lot of poems in high school, I don't remember why and honestly we lost all of those pieces sadly. I write again lately. Or perhaps we never do stop writing. I remember I always write something whenever I am in the mood, even if it means compromising sleep. I still remember you wrote a super long poem about friendship in high school, and it was in Bahasa Indonesia. It was in a piece of paper though, so I think we should just let it go. Let me tell you the exciting part, I am assisting a linguistics study! Yes, pumpkin, it is one of your dreams to do this, isn't it? I also read a lot of non-fiction again, now we can afford those books! I am enjoying one from Rolf Dobelli during my commute to work. Yes, we have another part-time job and it is in R&D!!! Oh darling, it is okay to shed tears. I told you, you won't regret your decision for choosing engineering physics.<br>
<br>
And hey, how is your little crush? The one that you met during the olympiad training in Semarang, haha. You are very cute, it's okay if he liked his friend, you will get over him in high school. High school huh, again, it's okay if you have little crushes with the mountain boy or even the basketball boy, you will get over them in the university. Talking about the one in university is way too risky here, but again, it's okay if it doesn't work out either. You stick to your plan at the end, don't you? Keeping yourself for the last love, you romantic queen! Thank you again for staying true to yourself, for taking mindful steps you won't regret, for respecting yourself and other people. You definitely need no courses in becoming a romantic person, it is in your blood, read those poems at your disposal. Excuse me, is this the 18th century?<br>
<br>
That's okay sweetheart, take all the time you need, pursue all the dreams you want to achieve, read all the books that you want to read, learn all the things you need for building a little family.<br>
<br>
It's already 1 in the morning, I hope you will enjoy your ride to the school tomorrow, don't forget to kiss your mom and dad's hands. I am beyond proud of you, see you again :)
