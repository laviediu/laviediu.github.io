I want to talk about my last day in Seoul but it wasn't as good as I expect it would be. The overtourism problem is real, to both residents and tourists. I was expecting to visit the beautiful and dreamy Bukchon village, despite the rain, with nice view and calm feelings. Yet, people are flooding the roads. There were no control over picture taking queue whatsoever. They forbid the tourists for entering the village at night and impose fine as the consequence, putting signs everywhere for people to lower their voices, not that it works fine. And yet still offering the place as one of the best spots in town, though it *is* a residential area. Why?<br>
<br>
Honestly, this trip has been eye-opening for me. I see things that I don't normally appreciate in my residential area and hometown. Perhaps because lately I have been fiery and my mind can't stop pouring ideas of how to make things better or simply to vent it out loud. Perhaps because of my PMS. Perhaps because ~~Indonesia~~ our dear government has been hostile and very *un-supercalifragilisticexpialidocious*, see, it is even harder to put into words. Fluff it.<br>
<br>
I want to visit Bali instead, I want to roam through Sumatra or remote places in the East, Maluku or perhaps Banda Neira. I want to write a travel book of them in the eyes of an Indonesian, to nudge the government to act on it, and *do something*. Perhpas, also, to gather investments for the facility construction. And, still, not letting overtourism takes charge. If only traveling in remote Indonesian places is easy, easier than smuggling the citizen's tax into one's pocket. Easier than creating programs without enforcing good quality control. Oh fluff.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am leaving Seoul tomorrow. Finally I can focus on my paper again for a while. All in all, I found the best tteokbokki I've savored. And it is worth the whole trip. Also, I was bombarded with questions during the talk I had in Yonsei, again, worth the trip. I always love an international conference talk because people are more proactive in asking questions. Well, the best part of a talk should be the Q&A session, or the worst if no one seems uninterested.<br>
<br>
Next stop, see you soon Indonesia.
