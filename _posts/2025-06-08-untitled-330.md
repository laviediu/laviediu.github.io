I used to run, circling in the woods<br>
I used to create a safe distance<br>
I used to chase the spark, blindly<br>
I used to feel all messiness in front of me<br>
<br>
But you<br>
<br>
This is unfamiliar<br>
This feels like riding a small boat on a river in the black forest,<br>
A fairy land I have always imagined<br>
<br>
And for the first time,<br>
I want to love myself the way you do.<br>
