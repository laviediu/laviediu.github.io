I don't know whether it is the number twenty five, the weather, the letting go, the counseling, or even the PhD, but I feel liberated lately. Shouldn't be the PhD though. I feel much more at peace. I feel loved, so full, that it is overflowing. I feel soaring energy to pursue my dreams. I feel alive, so alive, that I wish I could always go back to this state in the future. Alhamdulillah.

I did a solo travel, again, after a while. I went to Singapore. It was scorching hot. I was just enjoying my time, taking a long and exhausting walk in a garden, spending much of my holiday time at the museum, and was very warmly welcomed by the sisters at a mosque that I unintentionally entered. It felt like home. 

My tears wouldn't stop flowing when I returned back to Tokyo. I was so ashamed at the person sitting next to me during the flight, at the air hostess who asked my meals preference. 

I wonder, what kind of life I would live next, what kind of year I would remember 2025 as.
