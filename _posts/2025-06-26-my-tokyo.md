i am enjoying my two hours book reading in the train<br>
life feels soft whenever i meet my friends<br>
it is exciting whenever i solve problems at work<br>
my body feels good when my back touches its home, my bed<br>
it feels the most alive when i run at the park<br>
<br>
seeing a new book in my mailbox brings small joy<br>
receiving messages from friends bring bigger joy<br>
giving my seat to a grandma brings greater joy<br>
my heart is full after every call with my mom<br>
<br>
and the idea of loving myself, fully, sits me at peace<br>
<br>
my tokyo is messy<br>
it is loud and cold<br>
the tokyo that grows myself<br>
<br>
my tokyo is as soft as morning light<br>
the place where my heart and mind bloom<br>
