i am enjoying my two hours book reading in the train
life feels soft whenever i meet my friends
it is exciting whenever i solve problems at work
my body feels good when my back touches its home, my bed
it feels the most alive when i run at the park

seeing a new book in my mailbox brings small joy
receiving messages from friends bring bigger joy
giving my seat to a grandma brings greater joy
my heart is full after every call with my mom

and the idea of loving myself, fully, sits me at peace

my tokyo is messy
it is loud and cold
the tokyo that grows myself

my tokyo is as soft as morning light
the place where my heart and mind bloom
