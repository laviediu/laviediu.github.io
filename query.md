Like her pen name, Maryam Medina, which---as you presume---holds so much religious intentions to it, she would like to open up about her everlasting queries.<br>
<br>
She said, "I own the decision in choosing my faith, not because everyone around me embraces it, or because I am lazy enough to think and reflect, or because choosing nothing is easier than thinking clearly". Whatever, she believes in empirical data, just as much as superconductivity exists without no one knowing the mechanism of its existence. And I guess some of you say that the reason of its existence is irrelevant. Is love irrelevant? Ah, one anthropologist discovered that she could see the brain pattern of romantic love from MRI scans, so then can we see love now?<br>
<br>
Those are the kind of things that she would write. She is opening her old notes again, be prepared to see the other side of her poems. I think *A Letter to God* is a better title for this column but that's too long.<br>
<br>
A spoiler, she was binge-watching religious debates during the holy month. And yes, my fellow faithful friends, the Quran mentions too many verses for people to *think*, or perhaps as the opposition calls it, *"you are thinking but still restricting yourself"*. My friend, knock yourself out and prove it to yourself, not to them. Let's wish Richard Dawkins a good life and may he see the afterlife, though he won't be able to inform it to us then. And by the way, I respect him.
