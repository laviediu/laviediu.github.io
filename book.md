I don't like to rate books, I thoroughly pick what I want to read, and mostly they are non-fictions, a so-called boring for some.<br>
<br>
I was always wondering how a politician's life would look like, and Jacinda Ardern's *A Different Kind of Power* showed me pure bliss and respect. It inspires me to write the *memoir* column in this very blog. I am sure that if there are a lot of politicians like her, the world would feel less frightening.<br>
<br>
As a woman, I always see, from the media or entertainment shows, how we are pictured as less rational decision makers. How sensitive we are. I always hated it. Yet, as I saw my male cat, Mr. Scott, ignoring newborn kittens, it made me think differently. Also, after reading Jacinda Ardern's memoir. It is *indeed* a different kind of power, we are a born nurturer. We are equipped with all the things we need to become a mother. We are different to men, not less, not more, different.<br>
<br>
Those things said by the media made me read more books in cognitive thinking. Rolf Dobelli's *The Art of Thinking Clearly* is a very light read that came up with a lot of cognitive errors. It mentioned a lot of Nassim Taleb's *The Black Swan* and now I am reading it along with Daniel Kanehman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. Hoping that I would be a better decision maker, with *both* my sensitivity and rationality.<br>

And no, you can't tell kids what a woman can't do and what a man can, vice versa. They deserve to know that women and men are capable of doing everything, differently.
